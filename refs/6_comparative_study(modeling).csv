"QK84YEHR","webpage","2024","McGreivy, Nick; Hakim, Ammar","Weak baselines and reporting biases lead to overoptimism in machine learning for fluid-related partial differential equations","arXiv.org","","","","https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07218v1","One of the most promising applications of machine learning (ML) in computational physics is to accelerate the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The key objective of ML-based PDE solvers is to output a sufficiently accurate solution faster than standard numerical methods, which are used as a baseline comparison. We first perform a systematic review of the ML-for-PDE solving literature. Of articles that use ML to solve a fluid-related PDE and claim to outperform a standard numerical method, we determine that 79% (60/76) compare to a weak baseline. Second, we find evidence that reporting biases, especially outcome reporting bias and publication bias, are widespread. We conclude that ML-for-PDE solving research is overoptimistic: weak baselines lead to overly positive results, while reporting biases lead to underreporting of negative results. To a large extent, these issues appear to be caused by factors similar to those of past reproducibility crises: researcher degrees of freedom and a bias towards positive results. We call for bottom-up cultural changes to minimize biased reporting as well as top-down structural reforms intended to reduce perverse incentives for doing so.","2024-07-09","2024-07-23 00:33:46","2024-07-23 00:33:46","2024-07-23 00:33:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\IXA3AWDA\McGreivy y Hakim - 2024 - Weak baselines and reporting biases lead to overop.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
