However, solving high-dimensional PDEs has been notoriously difficult due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD). Among the pool of hyperbolic PDEs, the wave equation in particular is the base for modeling various clinical applications and designing many solutions in the medical fields of therapeutic and diagnostic ultrasound. This draws attention to the importance of accurate and efficient simulation. In recent years, deep neural networks have been proposed to predict numerical solutions of PDEs. Within that context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have surfaced as a powerful tool for modeling PDEs. We simulate a linear wave equation with a single time-dependent sinusoidal source function e.g.: sin (π t) using PINNs to model one of the most fundamental modeling equations in medical ultrasound applications. Results achieved are validated by an FDM solution with the same problem setup. After training, the PINN prediction takes an average time 47% of the FDM time performed by MATLAB for the same simulation metrics (IC, BC, and domain range) on the same machine. Being a mesh-free approach, PINNs overcome the CoD which is one of the main challenges in traditional modeling methods.","2021-09","2024-02-26 16:13:18","2024-02-26 16:13:18","2024-02-26 15:35:54","1-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1948-5727","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3SU3D8TC\9593574.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\FZKEEZBT\Alkhadhr et al. - 2021 - Modeling of the Forward Wave Propagation Using Phy.pdf","","","Forward Problem; Frequency division multiplexing; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Numerical Modelling; Numerical models; Physics-Informed Neural Networks; Propagation; Training; Ultrasonic imaging; Wave Equation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium (IUS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we present an algorithm for PINNs applied to the acoustic wave equation and test the method with both forward models and FWI case studies. These synthetic case studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point sources. PINNs' meshless formalism allows for a flexible implementation of the wave equation and different types of boundary conditions. For instance, our models demonstrate that PINN automatically satisfies absorbing boundary conditions, a serious computational challenge for common wave propagation solvers. Furthermore, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure can be seamlessly encoded in PINNs' formulation. We find that the current state-of-the-art PINNs provide good results for the forward model, even though spectral element or finite difference methods are more efficient and accurate. More importantly, our results demonstrate that PINNs yield excellent results for inversions on all cases considered and with limited computational complexity. We discuss the current limitations of the method with complex velocity models as well as strategies to overcome these challenges. Using PINNs as a geophysical inversion solver offers exciting perspectives, not only for the full waveform seismic inversions, but also when dealing with other geophysical datasets (e.g., MT, gravity) as well as joint inversions because of its robust framework and simple implementation.","2022","2024-01-30 18:47:28","2024-02-08 18:46:55","2024-01-30 18:47:28","e2021JB023120","","5","127","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2022.

WRI is often implemented by solving for the frequency-domain representation of the wavefield using the finite-difference method. The approach requires matrix inversions and affords limited flexibility to accommodate irregular model geometries. On the other hand, the physics-informed neural network (PINN) uses the underlying physical laws as loss functions to train the neural network (NN) to provide flexible continuous functional approximations of the solutions without matrix inversions. By including a data-constrained term in the loss function, the trained NN can reconstruct a wavefield that simultaneously fits the recorded data and satisfies the Helmholtz equation for a given initial velocity model. Using the predicted wavefields, we rely on a small-size NN to predict the velocity using the reconstructed wavefield. In this velocity prediction NN, spatial coordinates are used as input data to the network, and the scattered Helmholtz equation is used to define the loss function. After we train this network, we are able to predict the velocity in the domain of interest. We develop this PINN-based WRI method and demonstrate its potential using a part of the Sigsbee2A model and a modified Marmousi model. The results show that the PINN-based WRI is able to invert for a reasonable velocity with very limited iterations and frequencies, which can be used in a subsequent FWI application.","2022","2024-02-08 15:37:02","2024-02-08 18:46:17","","","","","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\R2AUVMGV\Song y Alkhalifah - 2022 - Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion via Physics-Inf.pdf","","Frequency-domain; Full-waveform inversion (FWI); Helmholtz equation; Inverse problems; Physics-informed neural network (PINN); Wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recently proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep-learning method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients are nonsmooth and describe structurally complex media. Thus, we solve the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field (Lippmann-Schwinger) wave equation in the frequency domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove the source singularity. We first illustrate that nonsmooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function to better couple the real and imaginary parts of the wavefield. Moreover, we design new neurons by replacing the classical affine function with a quadratic function in the argument of the activation function to better capture the nonsmooth features of the wavefields. We find that the PML condition and the quadratic functions improve the results including handling attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We also illustrate that a network trained to predict a wavefield for a specific medium can be used as an initial model of the neural network for predicting other wavefields corresponding to PDE-coefficient alterations and improving the convergence speed accordingly. This pretraining strategy should find applications in iterative full-waveform inversion and time-lag target-oriented imaging when the model perturbation between two consecutive iterations or two consecutive experiments is small.","2023-06-13","2024-07-23 00:32:48","2024-07-23 00:32:48","2024-02-28 16:43:03","T185-T202","","4","88","","Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\P9TX8BPP\Helmholtz-equation-solution-in-nonsmooth-media-by.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
