ML is a significant tool that can be applied across many disciplines, but its direct application to civil engineering problems can be challenging. ML for civil engineering applications that are simulated in the lab often fail in real-world tests. This is usually attributed to a data mismatch between the data used to train and test the ML model and the data it encounters in the real world, a phenomenon known as data shift. However, a physics-based ML model integrates data, partial differential equations (PDEs), and mathematical models to solve data shift problems. Physics-based ML models are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear equations. Physics-based ML, which takes center stage across many science disciplines, plays an important role in fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, computational resources, and data storage. This paper reviews the history of physics-based ML and its application in civil engineering.","2022-03-01","2024-02-22 21:18:32","2024-02-22 21:18:32","2024-02-19 17:48:20","100316","","","13","","Results in Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\92SPAILV\S2590123021001171.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\G8U9TL5E\Vadyala et al. - 2022 - A review of physics-based machine learning in civi.pdf","","","Civil engineering; Deep neural network; Machine learning; Physics-based machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has long benefited from intensive research into physics modeling and machine learning methods. However, in practice, the existing solutions often encounter difficulties caused by sparse data & incomplete system failure knowledge. Pure machine learning or physics-based methods can sometimes be infeasible in such situations. As a result, there has been a growing interest in developing physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models which allow incorporating different forms of physics knowledge at different positions of the machine learning pipeline. This combination provides significant assistance for detection, diagnostic, and prognostics. However, to the best of our knowledge, the bibliometrics analyses and the comprehensive review of the existing research concerning PIML in PHM remain vacant. Our review is therefore dedicated to filling these gaps. We synthesize the concept of PIML in PHM, and propose a taxonomy of PIML approaches from the perspective of “Expression forms of informed knowledge” and “Knowledge informed methods”. The findings and discussions presented in this paper enable us to clarify the current state of the art and the emerging opportunities of PIML approaches, especially for building PHM systems that can work under the “small data and scarce physics knowledge” paradigm.","2023-12-01","2024-02-22 21:18:18","2024-02-22 21:18:18","2024-02-19 17:57:54","325-352","","","124","","Applied Mathematical Modelling","Physics-informed machine learning in prognostics and health management","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\KWUJ2MBG\1-s2.0-S0307904X23003086-main.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\ALY9JBHI\Exported Items.bib; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\YA2H5WZN\S0307904X23003086.html","","","Knowledge; Physics-constraint learning; Physics-embedded algorithm structure; Physics-informed input space; Physics-informed machine learning; Prognostics and health management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Powerful tools for tasks that have been traditionally complex to automate have been developed, such as image synthesis and natural language processing. In the context of simulating fluid dynamics, this has led to a series of novel DL methods for replacing or augmenting conventional numerical solvers. We broadly classify these methods into physics- and data-driven methods. Physics-driven methods, generally, tune a DL model to provide an analytical and differentiable solution to a given fluid dynamics problem by minimizing the residuals of the governing partial differential equations. Data-driven methods provide a fast and approximate solution to any fluid dynamics problem that shares some physical properties with the observations used when tuning the DL model’s parameters. Meanwhile, the symbiosis of numerical solvers and DL has led to promising results in turbulence modelling and accelerating iterative solvers. However, these methods present some challenges. Exclusively data-driven flow simulators often suffer from poor extrapolation, error accumulation in time-dependent simulations, as well as difficulties in training against turbulent flows.

This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures.

These are heavily relied upon by imaging techniques in elastodynamics and electromagnetism, where they are crucial for the extraction of subsurface characteristics from ever larger and denser datasets. While high‐frequency or one‐way approximations are very powerful and efficient, they reach their limits when complex geological settings and solutions of full equations are required at finite frequencies. A review of three important formulations is carried out here: the spectral method, which is very efficient and accurate but generally restricted to simple earth structures and often layered earth structures; the pseudo‐spectral, finite‐difference and finite‐volume methods based on strong formulation of the partial differential equations, which are easy to implement and currently represent a good compromise between accuracy, efficiency and flexibility and the continuous or discontinuous Galerkin finite‐element methods that are based on the weak formulation, which lead to more accurate earth representations and therefore to more accurate solutions, although with higher computational costs and more complex use. The choice between these different approaches is still difficult and depends on the applications. Guidelines are given here through discussion of the requirements for imaging/inversion.","2011-08-22","2024-02-19 05:38:06","2024-02-19 05:38:06","2024-02-19 05:38:06","794-813","","Modelling Methods for Geophysical Imaging: Trends and Perspectives","59","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.earthdoc.org","","Publisher: European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\CV38FFXH\j.1365-2478.2011.00967.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\MD6VYIUD\Virieux et al. - 2011 - A review of the spectral, pseudo‐spectral, finite‐.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to its relative accuracy and computational efficiency it is the dominant method in modeling earthquake motion and it also is becoming increasingly more important in the seismic industry and for structural modeling. We first introduce basic formulations and properties of the finite-difference schemes including promising recent advances.

The method combines the flexibility of a finite element method with the accuracy of a spectral method. One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The wavefield on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based upon the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre integration rule. This combination of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix, which greatly simplifies the algorithm. We illustrate the great potential of the method by comparing it to a discrete wavenumber/reflectivity method for layer-cake models. Both body and surface waves are accurately represented, and the method can handle point force as well as moment tensor sources. For a model with very steep surface topography we successfully benchmark the method against an approximate boundary technique. For a homogeneous medium with strong attenuation we obtain excellent agreement with the analytical solution for a point force.","1999-12-01","2024-07-15 19:40:05","2024-07-15 19:40:05","2024-07-15 19:40:05","806-822","","3","139","","Geophysical Journal International","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\TAGS6BTV\Komatitsch y Tromp - 1999 - Introduction to the spectral element method for th.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\L3JEBIKT\587264.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
