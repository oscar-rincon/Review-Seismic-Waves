Similar to machine learning problems, the incorporation of more data can result in more robust and higher quality models. In this contribution, we present the new version of LASIF, an open-source LArge-scale Seismic Inversion Framework, which helps to automate many of the historically labor-intensive tasks that were bottlenecks in earlier FWI workflows and prevented the use of the larger datasets.

With neural operators, one can learn the general solution of Partial Differential Equations, such as the elastic wave equation, with varying parameters. There have been very few applications of neural operators in seismology. All of them were limited to two-dimensional settings, although the importance of three-dimensional (3D) effects is well known. In this work, we apply the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description. We used a high-fidelity simulation code, SEM3D, to build an extensive database of ground motions generated by 30,000 different geologies.

The advancement of deep learning enables solving partial differential equations, including wave equations, by applying neural networks to identify the mapping between the inputs and the solution. This approach can be faster than traditional numerical methods when numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted in practice. Instead, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. We also propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to out-of-distribution velocity models. Moreover, PFNO has robust performance in the presence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher computational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets than the traditional finite-difference method. The aforementioned advantages endow the FNO-based solver with the potential to build powerful models for research on seismic waves.","2022-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 22:35:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 28 - duplicated","","","","Ambient Seismic; Operator (biology); Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Noise; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Solver; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Data is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on FGA data, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method. Further, results with a high accuracy are shown for more complicated geometries including a three layered model, and a 2D-pocket model where the neural networks trained by both clean and noisy data.","2018-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:40:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 10","","","","Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Earthquake Detection; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Substructure; Synthetic data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recently proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep learning method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients are non-smooth and describe structurally-complex media. In this paper, we solve the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field wave equation in the frequency domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove source singularity. We first illustrate that non-smooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function of PINN and design a quadratic neural network to overcome the detrimental effects of non-smooth models in PINN. We show that PML and quadratic neurons improve the results as well as attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We also illustrate that a network trained during a wavefield simulation can be used to pre-train the neural network of another wavefield simulation after PDE-coefficient alteration and improve the convergence speed accordingly. This pre-training strategy should find application in iterative full waveform inversion (FWI) and time-lag target-oriented imaging when the model perturbation between two consecutive iterations or two consecutive experiments can be small.","2022-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 31","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Perfectly matched layer; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder is the recorded common shot gathers, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. Empirical results suggest that the cycle-skipping problem is largely mitigated compared to the conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) method by replacing the waveform differences by those of the latent-space parameters. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it provides a general framework for using solutions to the governing PDE to invert skeletal data generated by any type of a neural network. The governing equation can be that for gravity, seismic waves, electromagnetic fields, and magnetic fields. The input data can be the records from different types of data and their skeletal features, as long as the model parameters are sensitive to their perturbations. The skeletal data can be the latent space variables of an autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, or a feature map from a convolutional neural network (CNN), or principal component analysis (PCA) features.

An alternative approach is to solve the frequency domain Helmholtz equation, since it offers a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per frequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz solvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these approaches computationally infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high frequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer information gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a bottleneck for applications like full waveform inversion where repeated modeling is necessary. Therefore, recently a new approach based on the emerging paradigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve the Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several challenging associated with the conventional algorithms, including flexibility to model additional physics and the use of transfer learning to speed up computations. However, the approach still needs further developments to be fully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence speed and reduced accuracy, especially in presence of sharp heterogeneities in the velocity model. Therefore, with an eye on exploring how improved convergence can be obtained for the PINN Helmholtz solvers, we study different activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the swish activation function - a variant of ReLU that has shown improved performance on a number of data science problems.

We present a series of new open source deep learning algorithms to accelerate Bayesian full waveform point source inversion of microseismic events. Inferring the joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and source location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the inference process requires forward modelling of micro-seismic traces for each set of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference very computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process. We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on Gaussian Processes to invert microseismic events. For fairness of comparison, we train our emulators on the same microseismic traces and using the same geophysical setting. We show that all of our models provide more accurate predictions and ∼100 times faster predictions than the method based on Gaussian Processes, and a O(105) speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform generation. For example, a 2-s long synthetic trace can be generated in ∼10 ms on a common laptop processor, instead of ∼1 hr using a pseudo-spectral method on a high-profile Graphics Processing Units card. We also show that our inference results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from traditional location methods based on travel time estimates. The speed, accuracy and scalability of our open source deep learning models pave the way for extensions of these emulators to generic source mechanisms and application to joint Bayesian inversion of moment tensor components and source location using full waveforms.","2021-03-22","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:51:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 3 - duplicated","","","","Microseism; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly problematic for full waveform inversion, which typically involves numerous runs of the forward process. In machine learning there has been considerable recent work in the area of operator learning, with a new class of models called neural operators allowing for data-driven solutions to partial differential equations. Recent works in seismology have shown that when neural operators are adequately trained, they can significantly shorten the compute time for wave propagation. However, the memory required for the 3D time domain equations may be prohibitive. In this study, we show that these limitations can be overcome by solving the wave equations in the frequency domain, also known as the Helmholtz equations, since the solutions for a set of frequencies can be determined in parallel. The 3D Helmholtz neural operator is 40 times more memory-efficient than an equivalent time-domain version. We employ a U-shaped neural operator for 2D and 3D elastic wave modeling, achieving two orders of magnitude acceleration compared to a baseline spectral element method. The neural operator accurately generalizes to variable velocity structures and can be evaluated on denser input meshes than used in the training simulations. We also show that when solving for wavefields strictly on the surface, the accuracy can be significantly improved via a graph neural operator layer. In leveraging automatic differentiation, the proposed method can serve as an alternative to the adjoint-state approach for 3D full-waveform inversion, reducing the computation time by a factor of 350.","2023-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:40:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 11","","","","Deep Learning Models; Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Operator (biology); Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problems are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) like the wave or Maxwell's equations. Solving geophysical inversion problems is challenging due to the ill-posedness and high computational cost. To alleviate those issues, recent studies leverage deep neural networks to learn the inversion mappings from measurements to the property directly. In this paper, we show that such a mapping can be well modeled by a very shallow (but not wide) network with only five layers. This is achieved based on our new finding of an intriguing property: a near-linear relationship between the input and output, after applying integral transform in high dimensional space. In particular, when dealing with the inversion from seismic data to subsurface velocity governed by a wave equation, the integral results of velocity with Gaussian kernels are linearly correlated to the integral of seismic data with sine kernels. Furthermore, this property can be easily turned into a light-weight encoder-decoder network for inversion. The encoder contains the integration of seismic data and the linear transformation without need for fine-tuning. The decoder only consists of a single transformer block to reverse the integral of velocity. Experiments show that this interesting property holds for two geophysics inversion problems over four different datasets. Compared to much deeper InversionNet, our method achieves comparable accuracy, but consumes significantly fewer parameters.","2022-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:44","2024-09-04 21:39:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 6","","","","Geophysical Imaging; Geophysical Inversion; Inverse Problems; Inversion; Seismic Waveform Inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the advancement of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and incorporating the causal information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated. Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures.","2023-11-21","2024-09-04 21:18:44","2024-09-04 22:32:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 26 - duplicated","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Interpretability; Inverse Problems; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Event Classification; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Slowness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With neural operators, one can learn the general solution of Partial Differential Equations, such as the elastic wave equation, with varying parameters. There have been very few applications of neural operators in seismology. All of them were limited to two-dimensional settings, although the importance of three-dimensional (3D) effects is well known. In this work, we apply the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description. We used a high-fidelity simulation code, SEM3D, to build an extensive database of ground motions generated by 30,000 different geologies. With this database, we show that the FNO can produce accurate ground motion even when the underlying geology exhibits large heterogeneities. Intensity measures at moderate and large periods are especially well reproduced. We present the first seismological application of Fourier Neural Operators in 3D.

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion (FWI). However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the neural network (NN) a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source on the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach.","2021-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:44","2024-09-04 22:36:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 32 - duplicated","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The single-dimensional LS features mainly contain the kinematic information of the seismic data, which are automatically extracted from the seismic signal by using an autoencoder network. Because its LS feature dimension is too small to preserve the dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, of the seismic data. Therefore the NML inversion is not able to recover the high-wavenumber velocity details. To mitigate this problem, we propose to invert multi-dimensional LS features, which can fully represent the entire characters of the seismic data. We denote this method as multi-dimensional Newtonian machine learning (MNML). In MNML, we define a new multi-variable connective function that works together with the multi-variable implicit function theorem to connect the velocity perturbations to the multi-dimensional LS feature perturbations. Numerical tests show that (1) the multi-dimensional LS features can preserve more data information than the single-dimensional LS features; (2) a higher resolution velocity model can be recovered by inverting the multi-dimensional LS features, and the inversion quality is comparable to that of FWI; (3) the MNML method requires a much smaller storage space than conventional FWI because only the low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional seismic data are needed to be stored. The disadvantage of MNML is that it can more easily get stuck in local minima compared to the NML method. So we suggest a multiscale inversion approach that inverts for higher dimensional LS features as the iteration count increase.","2021-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:44","2024-09-04 22:30:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 24 - duplicated","","","","Ambient Seismic; Autoencoder; Inversion; Maxima and minima; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Noise; Seismic Waveform Inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to its large computation cost, most flavors of FWI rely only on the computation of the gradient of the loss function to estimate the update direction, therefore ignoring the contribution of the Hessian. Depending on the level of computational resources one can afford, an approximate of the inverse of the Hessian can be calculated and used to speed up the convergence of FWI towards the global (or a plausible local) minimum. In this work, we propose to use an approximate Hessian computed from a linearization of the wave-equation as commonly done in Least-Squares Migration (LSM). More precisely, we rely on the link between a migrated image and a doubly migrated image (i.e., an image obtained by demigration-migration of the migrated image) to estimate the inverse of the Hessian. However, instead of using non-stationary compact filters to link the two images and approximate the Hessian, we propose to use a deep neural network to directly learn the mapping between the FWI gradient (output) and its Hessian (blurred) counterpart (input). By doing so, the network learns to act as an approximate inverse Hessian: as such, when the trained network is applied to the FWI gradient, an enhanced update direction is obtained, which is shown to be beneficial for the convergence of FWI. The weights of the trained (deblurring) network are then transferred to the next FWI iteration to expedite convergence.
