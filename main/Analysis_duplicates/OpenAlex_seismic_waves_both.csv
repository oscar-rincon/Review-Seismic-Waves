In this study, we present an algorithm for PINNs applied to the acoustic wave equation and test the method with both forward models and FWI case studies. These synthetic case studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point sources. PINNs' meshless formalism allows for a flexible implementation of the wave equation and different types of boundary conditions. For instance, our models demonstrate that PINN automatically satisfies absorbing boundary conditions, a serious computational challenge for common wave propagation solvers. Furthermore, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure can be seamlessly encoded in PINNs' formulation. We find that the current state‐of‐the‐art PINNs provide good results for the forward model, even though spectral element or finite difference methods are more efficient and accurate. More importantly, our results demonstrate that PINNs yield excellent results for inversions on all cases considered and with limited computational complexity. We discuss the current limitations of the method with complex velocity models as well as strategies to overcome these challenges. Using PINNs as a geophysical inversion solver offers exciting perspectives, not only for the full waveform seismic inversions, but also when dealing with other geophysical datasets (e.g., MT, gravity) as well as joint inversions because of its robust framework and simple implementation.","2022-04-27","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:47:08","","","","5","127","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","75","","","","Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Full-Waveform Tomography; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost.","2020-01-01","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:43:25","","112266-112277","","","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","12","","","","Earthquake Detection; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we utilize a recently introduced machine-learning based framework called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the frequency-domain wave equation, which is also referred to as the Helmholtz equation, for isotropic and anisotropic media. Like functions, PINNs are formed by using a fully connected neural network (NN) to provide the wavefield solution at spatial points in the domain of interest, in which the coordinates of the point form the input to the network. We train such a network by backpropagating the misfit in the wave equation for the output wavefield values and their derivatives for many points in the model space. Generally, a hyperbolic tangent activation is used with PINNs, however, we use an adaptive sinusoidal activation function to optimize the training process. Numerical results show that PINNs with adaptive sinusoidal activation functions are able to generate frequency-domain wavefield solutions that satisfy wave equations. We also show the flexibility and versatility of the proposed method for various media, including anisotropy, and for models with strong irregular topography.","2021-10-23","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:43:35","","1750-1762","","3","228","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","15","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Activation function; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is exacerbated by the fact that new simulations must be performed whenever the velocity structure or source location is perturbed. Here, we explore a prototype framework for learning general solutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called neural operator. A trained neural operator can compute a solution in negligible time for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As neural operators are grid free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method’s applicability to seismic tomography, using reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure.

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder consists of seismic traces, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the Fréchet derivative, i.e., the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The gradient is computed by migrating the shifted observed traces weighted by the skeletonized data residual, and the final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. We denote this as inversion by Newtonian machine learning (NML) because it inverts for the model parameters by combining the forward and backward modeling of Newtonian wave propagation with the dimensional reduction capability of machine learning. Empirical results suggest that inversion by NML can sometimes mitigate the cycle-skipping problem of conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI). Numerical tests with synthetic and field data demonstrate the success of NML inversion in recovering a low-wavenumber approximation to the subsurface velocity model. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The disadvantage is that the inverted velocity model has less resolution compared with the FWI result, but it can serve as a good initial model for FWI. Our most significant contribution is that we provide a general framework for using wave-equation inversion to invert skeletal data generated by any type of neural network. In other words, we have combined the deterministic modeling of Newtonian physics and the pattern matching capabilities of machine learning to invert seismic data by NML.","2020-06-10","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:47:48","","WA185-WA200","","4","85","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","87","","","","Autoencoder; Inversion; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Synthetic data; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion. However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network (NN) parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the NN with a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source at the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach.","2021-12-01","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:50:08","","11-19","","","2","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","124","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the diffraction energy tends to be weak compared to the reflected energy and is also sensitive to inaccuracies in the migration velocity, making the identification of its signal challenging. In this work, we present an innovative workflow to automatically detect scattering points in the migration dip angle domain using deep learning. By taking advantage of the different kinematic properties of reflected and diffracted waves, we separate the two types of signals by migrating the seismic amplitudes to dip angle gathers using prestack depth imaging in the local angle domain. Convolutional neural networks are a class of deep learning algorithms able to learn to extract spatial information about the data in order to identify its characteristics. They have now become the method of choice to solve supervised pattern recognition problems. In this work, we use wave equation modelling to create a large and diversified dataset of synthetic examples to train a network into identifying the probable position of scattering objects in the subsurface. After giving an intuitive introduction to diffraction imaging and deep learning and discussing some of the pitfalls of the methods, we evaluate the trained network on field data and demonstrate the validity and good generalization performance of our algorithm. We successfully identify with a high‐accuracy and high‐resolution diffraction points, including those which have a low signal to noise and reflection ratio.

The monofrequency equation has the form of a Helmholtz equation. When solving the Helmholtz equation for seismic wavefields with multiple frequencies, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) can be used. However, the PINN suffers from the problem of spectral bias when approximating high-frequency components. We propose to simulate seismic multifrequency wavefields using a PINN with an embedded Fourier feature. The input to the Fourier feature PINN for simulating multifrequency wavefields is 4-D, namely the horizontal and vertical spatial coordinates of the model, the horizontal position of the source, and the frequency, and the output is multifrequency wavefields at arbitrary source positions. While an effective Fourier feature initialization strategy can lead to optimal convergence in training this network, the Fourier feature PINN simulates multifrequency wavefields with reasonable efficiency and accuracy.","2022-10-11","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:48:25","","1503-1514","","3","232","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","97","","","","Feature (linguistics); Helmholtz equation; Initialization; Position (finance); Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Signals; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Seismogram","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The total cost strictly depends on the number of frequency components that are considered, if using a finite-difference method. For the applications such as seismic imaging and inversion, high-frequency information is always required and thus the wave simulation is always a challenging task as it demands tremendous computational cost for obtaining dispersion-free high-frequency wavefields for large subsurface models. This paper demonstrates that a data-driven machine learning method, called the Fourier neural operator (FNO), is capable of predicting high-frequency wavefields, based on a limited number of low-frequency components. As the FNO method is for the first time applied to seismic wavefield extrapolation, the experiment reveals three attractive features with FNO: high efficiency, high accuracy and, importantly, the predicted high-frequency wavefields are dispersion free.","2022-04-01","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:45:44","","269-282","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","52","","","","Operator (biology); Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wavenumber","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thousands of such forward simulations are often a routine requirement for parameter estimation of microseimsic events via a suitable source inversion process. Parameter estimation based on forward modelling is often advantageous over a direct regression-based inversion approach when there are unknown number of parameters to be estimated and the seismic data have complicated noise characteristics which may not always allow a stable and unique solution in a direct inversion process. In this paper, starting from Graphics Processing Unit based synthetic simulations of a few thousand forward seismic shots due to microseismic events via pseudo-spectral solution of elastic wave equation, we develop a step-by-step process to generate a surrogate regression modelling framework, using machine learning techniques that can produce accurate seismograms at specified receiver locations. The trained surrogate models can then be used as a high-speed meta-model/emulator or proxy for the original full elastic wave propagator to generate seismic responses for other microseismic event locations also. The accuracies of the surrogate models have been evaluated using two independent sets of training and testing Latin hypercube quasi-random samples, drawn from a heterogeneous marine velocity model. The predicted seismograms have been used thereafter to calculate batch likelihood functions, with specified noise characteristics. Finally, the trained models on 23 receivers placed at the sea-bed in a marine velocity model are used to determine the maximum likelihood estimate of the event locations which can in future be used in a Bayesian analysis for microseismic event detection.","2018-07-19","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:49:16","","1257-1290","","2","215","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","110","","","","Microseism; Microseisms; Production Forecasting; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Seismogram; Synthetic seismogram","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The LS features are the effective low‐dimensional representation of the high‐dimensional seismic data. However, no equations exist to describe the relationship between the perturbation of an LS feature and the velocity perturbation. To address this problem, we use automatic differentiation (AD) to connect the two terms. Following this step, we use the wave‐equation inversion to invert the LS features for the subsurface velocity model. The HML misfit function measures the LS feature differences between the observed and predicted seismic data in a low‐dimensional space, which is less affected by the cycle‐skipping problem compared to the waveform mismatch in a high‐dimensional space. A low dimensional LS feature mainly contains the kinematic information of seismic data, while a large dimensional LS feature can also preserve the dynamic information of seismic data. Therefore, the HML inversion can recover the subsurface velocity model in a multiscale approach by inverting the LS features with different dimensions. Based on the different ways of utilizing AD to compute the velocity gradient, we propose full‐ and semi‐automatic approaches to solve this problem. These two approaches are mathematically equivalent; the former is easier to implement, while the latter is computationally more efficient. Numerical tests show that the HML inversion method can effectively recover both the low‐ and high‐wavenumber velocity information by inverting the LS features with different dimensions.","2021-09-01","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:47:37","","","","9","126","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","84","","","","Ambient Seismic; Autoencoder; Feature (linguistics); Feature vector; Inverse Problems; Inversion; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wavenumber","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

WRI is often implemented in the frequency domain, and thus, requires expensive matrix inversions to reconstruct the wavefield. A recently introduced machine learning (ML) framework, called physics-informed neural networks (NNs), is used to predict PDE solutions by setting the physical laws as loss functions. These NNs have shown their effectiveness in solving the Helmholtz equation specifically for the scattered wavefield. By including the recorded data at the sensors’ locations as a data constraint, the NNs can predict the wavefields which simultaneously fit the recorded data and satisfy the Helmholtz equation for a given initial velocity model. Using the predicted wavefields, we build another independent NN to predict the velocity that fits the wavefield. In this new NN, we use spatial coordinates as input to the network, and use the scattered Helmholtz wave to define the loss function. After we train this deep neural network, we are able to predict the velocity in the domain of interest. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed method using a square anomaly model and a simple layered model, and the initial results considering single frequency data show that the ML-based WRI is able to invert for reasonable velocity models.Presentation Date: Wednesday, October 14, 2020Session Start Time: 9:20 AMPresentation Time: 11:25 AMLocation: Poster Station 1Presentation Type: PosterKeywords: machine learning, full-waveform inversion, frequency-domain, acoustic, velocity analysisPermalink: https://doi.org/10.1190/segam2020-3427351.1FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byA deep learning-enhanced framework for multiphysics joint inversionYanyan Hu, Xiaolong Wei, Xuqing Wu, Jiajia Sun, Jiuping Chen, Yueqin Huang, and Jiefu Chen27 December 2022 | GEOPHYSICS, Vol. 88, No. 1Small-data-driven fast seismic simulations for complex media using physics-informed Fourier neural operatorsWei Wei and Li-Yun Fu24 November 2022 | GEOPHYSICS, Vol. 87, No. 6Waveform inversion of seismic first arrivals acquired on irregular surfaceXiang Li, Gang Yao, Fenglin Niu, Di Wu, and Nengchao Liu4 April 2022 | GEOPHYSICS, Vol. 87, No. 3A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equation using physics-informed neural networks23 October 2021 | Geophysical Journal International, Vol. 228, No. 3High-dimensional wavefield solutions based on neural network functionsTariq Alkhalifah, Chao Song, and Xinquan Huang1 September 2021A modified physics-informed neural network with positional encodingXinquan Huang, Tariq Alkhalifah, and Chao Song1 September 2021Solving the frequency-domain acoustic VTI wave equation using physics-informed neural networks11 January 2021 | Geophysical Journal International, Vol. 225, No. 2 SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts 2020ISSN (print):1052-3812 ISSN (online):1949-4645Copyright: 2020 Pages: 3887 publication data© 2020 Published in electronic format with permission by the Society of Exploration GeophysicistsPublisher:Society of Exploration Geophysicists HistoryPublished Online: 30 Sep 2020 CITATION INFORMATION Chao Song and Tariq Alkhalifah, (2020), ""Wavefield reconstruction inversion via machine learned functions,"" SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts : 1710-1714. https://doi.org/10.1190/segam2020-3427351.1 Plain-Language Summary Keywordsmachine learningfull-waveform inversionfrequency-domainacousticvelocity analysisPDF DownloadLoading ...","2020-09-30","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:50:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","123","","","","Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Inverse Problems; Inversion; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The drill-string dynamics are represented by a distributed dynamical model (wave equations) coupled with an ordinary differential equation at the downhole boundary (bit-rock interaction). The interaction between the drill-bit and rock can introduce severe vibrations in the drill-string and result in safety and performance issues. Consequently, the performance of drilling is interwoven with our knowledge of the subsurface. To address these problems, we propose a sensing and computational framework for estimating the drill-string dynamics and the specific intrinsic energy of the rocks while drilling. By exploiting the derived models' particular structure, we combine the drill-string dynamics modeling with top-drive hook-load (force) and hook-speed (velocity) measurements to estimate the force-on-bit without requiring the knowledge of the sub-surface. Then, we record and model the seismic radiation patterns of drill-bit rock interactions near the surface (i.e., seismic while drilling). Such an idea allows deriving an appropriate estimation of the rocks' intrinsic energy while drilling. We introduce two alternative rock property estimation algorithms based on direct parameter estimation and machine learning concepts to complete the analysis. The different approaches are tested and validated in simulations. We discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we show how to extend our methodologies in the presence of non-linear Coulomb friction terms and of coupled axial–torsional oscillations.","2021-11-01","2024-09-03 21:52:10","2024-09-04 21:48:15","","107836-107836","","","160","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","94","","","","Drill bit; Drill string; Drilling engineering; Vibration Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, the advancement of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and by incorporating the causal information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated. Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures.","2023-12-16","2024-09-03 21:52:11","2024-09-04 21:47:58","","13312-13312","","24","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","90","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Ambient Seismic; Interpretability; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Noise; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Slowness; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traveltime computations in anisotropic media, which are better representative of the true Earth, require solving the anisotropic eikonal equation. Numerical techniques to solve the anisotropic eikonal equation are known to suffer from instability and increased computational cost compared to the isotropic case. Here, we employ the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks to solve the anisotropic qP-wave eikonal equation. By minimizing a loss function formed by imposing the validity of the eikonal equation, we train a neural network to produce traveltime solutions that are consistent with the underlying partial differential equation. We observe considerably higher accuracy compared to the first-order finite-difference solution using the fast sweeping method. We also show that once the network is trained for a particular source location in a given anisotropic model, the traveltimes for a new source location and/or an updated model can be computed much more efficiently using the pre-trained network. This feature is particularly attractive as it can speed up seismic imaging and inversion applications significantly.Presentation Date: Wednesday, October 14, 2020Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Time: 2:40 PMLocation: 351FPresentation Type: OralKeywords: traveltime, anisotropy, TTI, neural networks, machine learningPermalink: https://doi.org/10.1190/segam2020-3423159.1FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byA physics‐guided neural network‐based approach to velocity model calibration for microseismic data5 March 2022 | Geophysical Prospecting, Vol. 70, No. 4Double-scale supervised inversion with a data-driven forward model for low-frequency impedance recoverySanyi Yuan, Xinqi Jiao, Yaneng Luo, Wenjing Sang, and Shangxu Wang27 December 2021 | GEOPHYSICS, Vol. 87, No. 2Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion via Physics-Informed Neural NetworksIEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol. 60A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equation using physics-informed neural networks23 October 2021 | Geophysical Journal International, Vol. 228, No. 3Traveltime computation using a supervised learning approachJubran Akram, Daniel B.

Inferring the joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and source location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the inference process requires forward modelling of microseismic traces for each set of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference very computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process. We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on Gaussian Processes to invert microseismic events. We show that all of our models provide more accurate predictions and $\sim 100$ times faster predictions than the method based on Gaussian Processes, and a $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform generation. For example, a 2-s long synthetic trace can be generated in $\sim 10$ ms on a common laptop processor, instead of $\sim$ 1 hr using a pseudo-spectral method on a high-profile Graphics Processing Units card. We also show that our inference results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from traditional location methods based on travel time estimates. The speed, accuracy and scalability of our open source deep learning models pave the way for extensions of these emulators to generic source mechanisms and application to joint Bayesian inversion of moment tensor components and source location using full waveforms.","2021-07-29","2024-09-03 21:52:11","2024-09-04 21:43:43","","1683-1705","","7","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","17","","","","Deep Learning Models; Microseism; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Uncertainty Quantification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainties exist in data measurements, source positioning, and subsurface geophysical properties. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a high-resolution depth migration approach useful for extracting information such as reservoir localization and boundaries. RTM, however, is time-consuming and data-intensive as it requires computing twice the wave equation to generate and store an imaging condition. RTM, when embedded in an uncertainty quantification algorithm (like the Monte Carlo method), shows a many-fold increase in its computational complexity due to the high input-output dimensionality. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder deep learning surrogate model for RTM under uncertainty. Inputs are an ensemble of velocity fields, expressing the uncertainty, and outputs the seismic images. We show by numerical experimentation that the surrogate model can reproduce the seismic images accurately, and, more importantly, the uncertainty propagation from the input velocity fields to the image ensemble.","2021-04-06","2024-09-03 21:52:11","2024-09-04 21:43:46","","1229-1250","","3","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","18","","","","Autoencoder; Geophysical imaging; Inverse Problems; Propagation of uncertainty; Reservoir Simulation; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic migration; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Surrogate model; Synthetic data; Uncertainty quantification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, numerical solutions are susceptible to dispersion artifacts, and they often require considerable computational resources. Moreover, their accuracy is dependent on the size of discretization, which is a function of the operating frequency. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated the potential to tackle long-standing challenges in seismic modeling and inversion, addressing the associated computational bottleneck and numerical dispersion artifacts. Despite progress, PINNs exhibit spectral bias, resulting in a stronger capability to learn low-frequency features over high-frequency ones. This paper proposes the use of a simple fully-connected PINN model, and evaluates its potential to interpolate and extrapolate scattered wavefields that correspond to the acoustic VTI wave equation across multiple frequencies. The issue of spectral bias is tackled by incorporating the Kronecker neural network architecture with composite activation function formed using the inverse tangent (atan), exponential linear unit (elu), locally adaptive sine (l-sin), and locally adaptive cosine (l-cos) activation functions. This allows the construction of an effectively wider neural network with a minimal increase in the number of trainable parameters. The proposed scheme keeps the network size fixed for multiple frequencies and does not require repeated training at each frequency. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in fast and accurate, anisotropic multi-frequency wavefield modeling.","2023-08-08","2024-09-03 21:52:11","2024-09-04 21:46:24","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","64","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Frequency-Dependent Anisotropy; Seismic Data Processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, first arrivals can be compressed in a low-rank sense with their skeletal features extracted by a well-trained autoencoder. Empirical experiments suggest that the autoencoder’s <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$1\times 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula> or <inline-formula xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink""> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$2\times 1$ </tex-math></inline-formula> latent vectors vary continuously with respect to the input seismic data. It is, therefore, reasonable to introduce a misfit functional measuring the discrepancies between the predicted and the observed data in a low-dimensional latent space. The benefit of this approach is that an elaborated autoencoding neural network not only refines intrinsic information hidden in the refractions but also improves the quality of inversion for a reliable background velocity model. Numerical tests on both synthetic and field data demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, especially in recovering the low-to-intermediate wavenumber parts of the subsurface velocity distribution. Comparisons are made with the other three relevant methods, the wave-equation travel-time (WT) inversion, the envelope inversion, and the full waveform inversion (FWI). As expected, the cycle skipping problem is alleviated due to the reduction of dimensions of data space. This method outperforms the envelope inversion in resolution, and it is no worse than WT.

Newtonian coupling of ground vibrations to the core optics of the detectors may limit the sensitivity of Einstein Telescope at frequencies below about 10 Hz. The contribution of Newtonian noise is site specific and depends on the ambient seismic field which in turn depends on the site’s geology and the distribution of surface and underground seismic-noise sources. We have investigated the application of machine learning in combination with the deployment of seismic sensor networks to predict seismic displacement noise at specific locations on the surface and underground. Moreover we have modeled a deep neural network (DNN) that allows to subtract Newtonian noise from the strain data measured by Einstein Telescope. The seismic-field model is based on a complete solution of the elastodynamic wave equations for a horizontally-layered soil structure. The geology features soft-soil layers on hard-rock and was shown to be effective in attenuating Newtonian noise from surface waves below the required sensitivity. In addition our model includes a random background of body waves with all possible angles of incidence. We show that a DNN is effective in predicting Newtonian noise. Application of our DNN allows Newtonian noise subtraction by a factor up to 4.7 at 1 Hz and 2.5 at 5 Hz.","2023-09-18","2024-09-03 21:52:11","2024-09-04 21:43:29","","205008-205008","","20","40","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","13","","","","Earthquake Detection; Einstein Telescope; Seismic Noise; Seismic Phase Picking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two‐step dispersion inversion schema is the dominant method used to invert the surface wave data generated by the cross‐correlation of ambient noise signals. However, the two‐step methods have a 1‐D layered model assumption, which does not account for the complex wave propagation. To overcome this limitation, we employ a 2‐D wave‐equation dispersion (WD) inversion method which reconstructs the subsurface shear ( S ) velocity model in one step, and elastic wave‐equation modeling is used to simulate the subsurface wave propagation. In the WD method, the optimal S velocity model is obtained by minimizing the dispersion curve differences between the observed and predicted surface wave data, which makes WD method less prone to getting stuck to local minima. In our study, the observed Scholte waves are generated by cross‐correlating continuous ambient noise signals recorded by each ocean bottom node (OBN) in the 3‐D Gorgon OBN survey, Western Australia. For every two OBN lines, the WD method is used to retrieve the 2‐D S velocity structure beneath the first line. We then use a robust neural network (NN)‐based method to interpolate the inverted 2‐D velocity slices to a continuous 3‐D velocity model and also generate a corresponding uncertainty model. Moreover, we compared the predicted dispersion curves and waveforms to the observed data, and a robust waveform and dispersion match are observed across all of the Gorgon OBN lines.","2022-12-01","2024-09-03 21:52:11","2024-09-04 21:42:51","","","","12","127","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","1","","","","Ambient noise level; Ambient Seismic; Interpolation (computer graphics); Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Noise; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Training data for deep neural networks is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on data generated by the FGA, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method. Further, results with a high accuracy are shown for more complicated geometries including a three-layered model, a sine interface, and a 2D-pocket model where the neural networks are trained by both clean and noisy data.","2020-05-01","2024-09-03 21:52:11","2024-09-04 21:44:33","","109313-109313","","","409","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","33","","","","Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Earthquake Detection; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Substructure; Synthetic data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This reliance on full sampling and high-fidelity wavefield simulations strains our acquisition and processing systems and overcoming this impediment is becoming one of the main challenges faced by our industry. By using randomized dimensionality-reduction techniques, we propose a new strategy where acquisition and computational costs are no longer dictated by the sampling grid but by transform-domain compressibility of the image. To arrive at this result, we combine recent findings from machine learning / stochastic optimization—where (nonlinear) inversions are carried out on random subsets of data—and compressive sensing—where data that permit compressible representations are deliberately subsampled. The key idea of the stochastic approximation is to reduce computational costs by computing each gradient update on a different randomly selected subset of data. In seismic exploration, this corresponds to carrying out migrations with one or a few incoherent supershots made of superpositions of random source-encoded experiments. While this approach introduces source cross talk, it has been applied successfully to reduce the cost of least-squares migration and full-waveform inversion because it reduces the number of wave-equation solves. However, the method is sensitive to noise and relies on relatively large numbers of supershots and wave simulations to get reasonable results.","2011-05-27","2024-09-03 21:52:12","2024-09-04 21:49:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","112","","","","Compressed Sensing; Convex Optimization; Data Assimilation; Optimization; Seismic Data Processing; Variance reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advancement of deep learning enables solving partial differential equations, including wave equations, by applying neural networks to identify the mapping between the inputs and the solution. This approach can be faster than traditional numerical methods when numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted in practice. Instead, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. We also propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to out-of-distribution velocity models. Moreover, PFNO has robust performance in the presence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher computational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets than the traditional finite-difference method.

In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Data is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on FGA data, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method. Further, results with a high accuracy are shown for more complicated geometries including a three layered model, and a 2D-pocket model where the neural networks trained by both clean and noisy data.","2018-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:40:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 10","","","","Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Earthquake Detection; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Substructure; Synthetic data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recently proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep learning method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients are non-smooth and describe structurally-complex media. In this paper, we solve the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field wave equation in the frequency domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove source singularity. We first illustrate that non-smooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function of PINN and design a quadratic neural network to overcome the detrimental effects of non-smooth models in PINN. We show that PML and quadratic neurons improve the results as well as attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We also illustrate that a network trained during a wavefield simulation can be used to pre-train the neural network of another wavefield simulation after PDE-coefficient alteration and improve the convergence speed accordingly. This pre-training strategy should find application in iterative full waveform inversion (FWI) and time-lag target-oriented imaging when the model perturbation between two consecutive iterations or two consecutive experiments can be small.","2022-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:41:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 31","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Perfectly matched layer; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder is the recorded common shot gathers, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. Empirical results suggest that the cycle-skipping problem is largely mitigated compared to the conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) method by replacing the waveform differences by those of the latent-space parameters. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it provides a general framework for using solutions to the governing PDE to invert skeletal data generated by any type of a neural network. The governing equation can be that for gravity, seismic waves, electromagnetic fields, and magnetic fields. The input data can be the records from different types of data and their skeletal features, as long as the model parameters are sensitive to their perturbations. The skeletal data can be the latent space variables of an autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, or a feature map from a convolutional neural network (CNN), or principal component analysis (PCA) features.

An alternative approach is to solve the frequency domain Helmholtz equation, since it offers a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per frequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz solvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these approaches computationally infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high frequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer information gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a bottleneck for applications like full waveform inversion where repeated modeling is necessary. Therefore, recently a new approach based on the emerging paradigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve the Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several challenging associated with the conventional algorithms, including flexibility to model additional physics and the use of transfer learning to speed up computations. However, the approach still needs further developments to be fully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence speed and reduced accuracy, especially in presence of sharp heterogeneities in the velocity model. Therefore, with an eye on exploring how improved convergence can be obtained for the PINN Helmholtz solvers, we study different activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the swish activation function - a variant of ReLU that has shown improved performance on a number of data science problems.

We present a series of new open source deep learning algorithms to accelerate Bayesian full waveform point source inversion of microseismic events. Inferring the joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and source location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the inference process requires forward modelling of micro-seismic traces for each set of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference very computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process. We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on Gaussian Processes to invert microseismic events. For fairness of comparison, we train our emulators on the same microseismic traces and using the same geophysical setting. We show that all of our models provide more accurate predictions and ∼100 times faster predictions than the method based on Gaussian Processes, and a O(105) speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform generation. For example, a 2-s long synthetic trace can be generated in ∼10 ms on a common laptop processor, instead of ∼1 hr using a pseudo-spectral method on a high-profile Graphics Processing Units card. We also show that our inference results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from traditional location methods based on travel time estimates. The speed, accuracy and scalability of our open source deep learning models pave the way for extensions of these emulators to generic source mechanisms and application to joint Bayesian inversion of moment tensor components and source location using full waveforms.","2021-03-22","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:51:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 3 - duplicated","","","","Microseism; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In machine learning there has been considerable recent work in the area of operator learning, with a new class of models called neural operators allowing for data-driven solutions to partial differential equations. Recent works in seismology have shown that when neural operators are adequately trained, they can significantly shorten the compute time for wave propagation. However, the memory required for the 3D time domain equations may be prohibitive. In this study, we show that these limitations can be overcome by solving the wave equations in the frequency domain, also known as the Helmholtz equations, since the solutions for a set of frequencies can be determined in parallel. The 3D Helmholtz neural operator is 40 times more memory-efficient than an equivalent time-domain version. We employ a U-shaped neural operator for 2D and 3D elastic wave modeling, achieving two orders of magnitude acceleration compared to a baseline spectral element method. The neural operator accurately generalizes to variable velocity structures and can be evaluated on denser input meshes than used in the training simulations. We also show that when solving for wavefields strictly on the surface, the accuracy can be significantly improved via a graph neural operator layer. In leveraging automatic differentiation, the proposed method can serve as an alternative to the adjoint-state approach for 3D full-waveform inversion, reducing the computation time by a factor of 350.","2023-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:43","2024-09-04 21:40:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 11","","","","Deep Learning Models; Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Operator (biology); Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The problems are governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) like the wave or Maxwell's equations. Solving geophysical inversion problems is challenging due to the ill-posedness and high computational cost. To alleviate those issues, recent studies leverage deep neural networks to learn the inversion mappings from measurements to the property directly. In this paper, we show that such a mapping can be well modeled by a very shallow (but not wide) network with only five layers. This is achieved based on our new finding of an intriguing property: a near-linear relationship between the input and output, after applying integral transform in high dimensional space. In particular, when dealing with the inversion from seismic data to subsurface velocity governed by a wave equation, the integral results of velocity with Gaussian kernels are linearly correlated to the integral of seismic data with sine kernels. Furthermore, this property can be easily turned into a light-weight encoder-decoder network for inversion. The encoder contains the integration of seismic data and the linear transformation without need for fine-tuning. The decoder only consists of a single transformer block to reverse the integral of velocity. Experiments show that this interesting property holds for two geophysics inversion problems over four different datasets.

In recent years, the advancement of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and incorporating the causal information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated. Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures.","2023-11-21","2024-09-04 21:18:44","2024-09-04 22:32:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 26 - duplicated","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Interpretability; Inverse Problems; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Event Classification; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Slowness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we apply the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description. We used a high-fidelity simulation code, SEM3D, to build an extensive database of ground motions generated by 30,000 different geologies.

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion (FWI). However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the neural network (NN) a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source on the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach.","2021-01-01","2024-09-04 21:18:44","2024-09-04 22:36:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Preprint - 32 - duplicated","","","","Acoustic wave equation; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Wave Equation Migration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The single-dimensional LS features mainly contain the kinematic information of the seismic data, which are automatically extracted from the seismic signal by using an autoencoder network. Because its LS feature dimension is too small to preserve the dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, of the seismic data. Therefore the NML inversion is not able to recover the high-wavenumber velocity details. To mitigate this problem, we propose to invert multi-dimensional LS features, which can fully represent the entire characters of the seismic data. We denote this method as multi-dimensional Newtonian machine learning (MNML). In MNML, we define a new multi-variable connective function that works together with the multi-variable implicit function theorem to connect the velocity perturbations to the multi-dimensional LS feature perturbations. Numerical tests show that (1) the multi-dimensional LS features can preserve more data information than the single-dimensional LS features; (2) a higher resolution velocity model can be recovered by inverting the multi-dimensional LS features, and the inversion quality is comparable to that of FWI; (3) the MNML method requires a much smaller storage space than conventional FWI because only the low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional seismic data are needed to be stored. The disadvantage of MNML is that it can more easily get stuck in local minima compared to the NML method.

Due to its large computation cost, most flavors of FWI rely only on the computation of the gradient of the loss function to estimate the update direction, therefore ignoring the contribution of the Hessian. Depending on the level of computational resources one can afford, an approximate of the inverse of the Hessian can be calculated and used to speed up the convergence of FWI towards the global (or a plausible local) minimum. In this work, we propose to use an approximate Hessian computed from a linearization of the wave-equation as commonly done in Least-Squares Migration (LSM). More precisely, we rely on the link between a migrated image and a doubly migrated image (i.e., an image obtained by demigration-migration of the migrated image) to estimate the inverse of the Hessian. However, instead of using non-stationary compact filters to link the two images and approximate the Hessian, we propose to use a deep neural network to directly learn the mapping between the FWI gradient (output) and its Hessian (blurred) counterpart (input). By doing so, the network learns to act as an approximate inverse Hessian: as such, when the trained network is applied to the FWI gradient, an enhanced update direction is obtained, which is shown to be beneficial for the convergence of FWI. The weights of the trained (deblurring) network are then transferred to the next FWI iteration to expedite convergence.
