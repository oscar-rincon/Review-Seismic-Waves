However, the necessity of using large training data and the ‘black box’ nature of learning have limited them in practice and difficult to interpret. Furthermore, including the governing equations and physical facts in such methods is also another challenge, which entails either ignoring the physics or simplifying them using unrealistic data. To address such issues, physics informed machine learning methods have been developed which can integrate the governing physics law into the learning process. In this work, a 1-dimensional (1D) time-dependent seismic wave equation is considered and solved using two methods, namely Gaussian process (GP) and physics informed neural networks. We show that these meshless methods are trained by smaller amount of data and can predict the solution of the equation with even high accuracy. They are also capable of inverting any parameter involved in the governing equation such as wave velocity in our case. Results show that the GP can predict the solution of the seismic wave equation with a lower level of error, while our developed neural network is more accurate for velocity (P- and S-wave) and density inversion.",2020-11-01,2024-02-01 23:38:43,2024-09-02 14:42:41,2024-02-01 23:38:43,1993-2001,,6.0,11,,Geoscience Frontiers,Physics informed machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,25 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\TLCZRAWN\Karimpouli and Tahmasebi - 2020 - Physics informed machine learning Seismic wave eq.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\L8R35MEI\S1674987120301717.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\PL8KJIBX\S1674987120301717.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\MS77RZSL\display.html,,Gaussian process (GP); Optimization; Physics informed machine learning (PIML); Seismic wave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of efficient PDEs solving methods lies in their ability to provide rapid simulations and real-time predictions. However, as the scale and dimensionality of the problems increase, the efficiency of current numerical methods becomes a concern. Therefore, this study leverages the inherent connection between the temporal-spatial stepping processes and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as well as convolutional layers (CLs) to propose a general-purpose recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) platform for solving PDEs. The RCNN platform rigorously executes the temporal-spatial iterations involved in discretized forms of PDEs.

In seismology, it regulates seismic wave traveltimes needed for applications like source localization, imaging, and inversion. Several numerical algorithms have been developed over the years to solve the eikonal equation. However, these methods require considerable modifications to incorporate additional physics, such as anisotropy, and may even breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods. Moreover, they suffer from computational bottleneck when repeated computations are needed for perturbations in the velocity model and/or the source location, particularly in large 3D models. Here, we propose an algorithm to solve the eikonal equation based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). By minimizing a loss function formed by imposing the eikonal equation, we train a neural network to output traveltimes that are consistent with the underlying partial differential equation. We observe sufficiently high traveltime accuracy for most applications of interest. We also demonstrate how the proposed algorithm harnesses machine learning techniques like transfer learning and surrogate modeling to speed up traveltime computations for updated velocity models and source locations. Furthermore, we use a locally adaptive activation function and adaptive weighting of the terms in the loss function to improve convergence rate and solution accuracy. We also show the flexibility of the method in incorporating medium anisotropy and free-surface topography compared to conventional methods that require significant algorithmic modifications. These properties of the proposed PINN eikonal solver are highly desirable in obtaining a flexible and efficient forward modeling engine for seismological applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2024-08-24 16:01:01,2024-08-26 04:40:34,,,,,155,,,PINNeik,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,28 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XXHQGT7M\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\MI57RJ84\Waheed et al. - 2021 - PINNeik Eikonal solution using physics-informed n.pdf,,,Eikonal equation; Physics-informed neural networks; Seismic modeling; Traveltimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Solving for the frequency-domain scattered wavefield via physics-informed neural network (PINN) has great potential in increasing the flexibility and reducing the computational cost of seismic modeling and inversion. However, when dealing with high-frequency wavefields using PINN, its accuracy and training cost limit its application. Thus, we propose a novel implementation of PINN using frequency upscaling and neuron splitting, which allows the neural network model to grow in size as we increase the frequency while leveraging the information from the pre-trained model for lower-frequency wavefields, resulting in fast convergence to highly accurate wavefield solutions.

MHPCN5LE,journalArticle,2023,"Yu, Y.; Li, Y.; Wu, X.; Jia, X.",Enhancing one-way wave equation-based migration with deep learning,Geophysics,,,10.1190/geo2022-0159.1,,"One advantage of one-way wave equation-based migration is its low computational cost. However, due to the limited wavefield propagation angle, it is difficult to use one-way wave equation-based migration for high-precision imaging of structures with large inclinations due to issues such as inaccurate amplitudes and migration image artifacts. In addition, when the model has large horizontal velocity differences, it is difficult for the one-way wave propagator to calculate an accurate wavefield phase. Reverse time migration (RTM) based on the two-way wave propagator has a high resolution and avoids the issues associated with one-way wave propagators; however, it has a high computational cost in practical applications. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) application mode that improves one migration method by learning from another one and design a CNN with a structure similar to U-net that combines the advantages of both migration methods. The CNN label is the RTM result, and the corresponding input is the result of one-way wave migration with a generalized screen propagator (GSP). The trained CNN model improves the amplitude in the one-way wave migration image and removes the errors caused by large lateral velocity perturbations. Moreover, by maintaining the high migration calculation efficiency, our CNN model allows for a high resolution, few artifacts, and accurate images of steep structures in the one-way wave migration result. With our method, the accuracy of the one-way wave migration result is close to that of the RTM result. The use of GSP-based migration in our CNN model rather than conventional RTM to generate prospecting images can considerably reduce the calculation costs. © 2023 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",2023,2024-08-24 16:07:36,2024-08-26 05:19:03,,WA105-WA114,,1.0,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,34 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\55MBFY4G\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\CU2CLGWQ\Yu et al. - 2023 - Enhancing one-way wave equation-based migration wi.pdf,,,high resolution; machine learning; migration; one way; reverse time migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To solve a frequency-domain wave equation, we often need to invert the impedance matrix. This results in a dramatic increase in computational cost as the model size increases. It is even a bigger challenge for anisotropic media, where the impedance matrix is far more complex. In addition, the conventional finite-difference method produces numerical dispersion artefacts in solving acoustic wave equations for anisotropic media. To address these issues, we use the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain wavefield solutions for an acoustic wave equation for transversely isotropic (TI) media with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). PINNs utilize the concept of automatic differentiation to calculate their partial derivatives, which are free of numerical dispersion artefacts. Thus, we use the wave equation as a loss function to train a neural network to provide functional solutions to the acoustic VTI form of the wave equation. Instead of predicting the pressure wavefields directly, we solve for the scattered pressure wavefields to avoid dealing with the point-source singularity. We use the spatial coordinates as input data to the network, which outputs the real and imaginary parts of the scattered wavefields and auxiliary function. After training a deep neural network, we can evaluate the wavefield at any point in space almost instantly using this trained neural network without calculating the impedance matrix inverse. We demonstrate these features on a simple 2-D anomaly model and a 2-D layered model.

However, when multiple parameters are updated simultaneously, the gradients of the loss function with respect to these parameters will be coupled together, the effect exacerbate the nonlinear problem. We propose a parametric EFWI method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN-EFWI). The parameters that need to be updated are the weights in the neural network rather than the elastic models. The convolutional kernel in the network can increase spatial correlations of elastic models, which can be regard as a regularization strategy to mitigate local minima issue. Furthermore, the representation also can mitigate the cross-talk between parameters due to the reconstruction of Frechét derivatives by neural networks. Both forward and backward processes are implemented using a time-domain finite-difference solver for elastic wave equation. Numerical examples on overthrust models, fluid saturated models and 2004 BP salt body models demonstrate that CNN-EFWI can partially mitigate the local minima problem and reduce the dependence of inversion on the initial models. Mini-batch configuration is used to speed up the update and achieve fast convergence.

The acoustic wave equation (AWE) is often used for studying wave propagation in both fluids and solids and is crucial for many applications including seismic imaging and inversion and non-destructive testing. Because analytical AWE solutions rarely exist for complex heterogeneous media, methods for generating numerical AWE solutions are very desirable. Traditional numerical solvers require discrete model representations with many restrictions placed on the shape and spacing of grid elements. This work uses a relatively new class of numerical solvers known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that provide a mesh-free alternative for generating AWE solutions using a deep neural-network framework. We encapsulate a time-domain AWE formulation within a loss function that is used to train network parameters. The initial conditions are implemented by enforcing hard constraints on the neural network instead of including them as separate loss-function terms. We also use a Fourier neural network (FNN) to alleviate the spectral bias commonly observed when using fully connected neural network in the conventional PINN approach. Numerical tests on both 2D homogeneous and heterogeneous velocity models confirm the accuracy of our approach. We observe that using FNNs helps in the convergence of AWE solutions especially for heterogeneous models. We compare PINN-based solutions with those computed by the highly accurate conventional pseudo-spectral method, and observe that the normalized energy differences between the two sets of solutions were less than 4% for all numerical tests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,2024-08-24 16:37:18,2024-08-26 15:21:49,,737-751,,5.0,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,54 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\4DQI2I7K\Sethi et al. - 2023 - Hard enforcement of physics-informed neural networ.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\K4Y9AI94\display.html,,,Acoustic; Neural networks; Physics informed; Wave propagation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If seismic data lack low frequencies, their resolution deteriorates, leading to inaccurate seismic interpretations. To resolve this problem, we developed a low-frequency reconstruction that employs a modified U-Net neural network. To improve the training of the neural network, we generated training data analogous to unseen data, based on the far-field signature as the wavelet source to retain the spectral characteristics of field data. We addressed potential overfitting by generating a large amount of various synthetic data through wave equation-based modelling using a variety of velocity and density models. After synthesising the seismic data, we implemented a filtering method to produce input data with insufficient low frequencies and label data with sufficient low frequencies. The far-field signature plays an important role in the successful reconstruction of low frequencies due to its intrinsic field data features and greater low-frequency information compared to field data alone. We tested the generalisation of the network using unseen synthetic and field data not used in the training stage, and analyzed the results in the time and frequency domains. Although the input data did not retain frequencies below 10 Hz, the trained network predicted low frequencies that were similar to the desired data. We also produced post-stack sections via simple processing to evaluate low-frequency reconstructions produced by our trained network.

New sets of the second order viscoacoustic and viscoelastic anisotropic wave equations are established with the new recursive temporal convolutions, which completely replaces the traditional auxiliary differential equations of the memory variables.

Employing the acoustic or elastic wave equation, inversion starts with approximate initial values of subsurface parameters, which are typically updated in iterative fashion. Here, we propose a two-stage unsupervised machine-learning (ML) methodology for efficient and accurate seismic impedance inversion. The first stage utilizes the generalization capability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to produce realistic estimates of the acoustic impedance (AI), whereas the second stage incorporates physics information to generate synthetic data from the subsurface AI distribution. We also add Bayesian layers to the first stage of the network to evaluate the model errors. The proposed probabilistic approach to deep learning allows one to estimate the uncertainty of the inverted parameters, which enhances the interpretability of the model. We apply the algorithm to a poststack data set generated using the CGG Hampson-Russell software. After conducting network training with a sufficient number of data points, the network is applied to the rest of the data to estimate the model parameters. The developed approach has a significant advantage over more conventional ML strategies because it produces statistically justified uncertainty maps and eliminates the need to use labeled data for training. © 2023 Geophysical Press Ltd.",2023,2024-08-24 17:21:16,2024-09-02 15:59:19,,257-270,,3.0,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,70 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\AT7Q3C4G\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\MUGPHZDW\Zhang et al. - 2023 - PHYSICS-GUIDED UNSUPERVISED DEEP-LEARNING SEISMIC .pdf,,,model evaluation; physics guided machine learning; seismic inversion; uncertainty quantification; unsupervised learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, conventional rock physics models (RPMs), e.g., the Xu-White model, struggle to accurately obtain the key parameters such as pore aspect ratio in the process of S-wave velocity prediction. This work performs a comparative study of S-wave velocity prediction based on deep neural network (DNN) and RPM for such reservoirs. By employing the poroelasticity equations which are capable of describing elastic wave propagation in the complex reservoirs saturated with viscous fluid, the relation between elastic and petrophysical properties is established with a DNN-based method. This approach quantifies the connection between P-/S-wave velocities and rock properties. On the other hand, we reformulate the traditional Xu-White model by incorporating the decoupled Kuster-Toksöz (K-T) model and the poroelasticity equations with viscoelastic fluid in the modeling process. The variation of pore aspect ratio with depth is also considered to characterize the complex pore structures, which is appropriate for improving the accuracy of prediction. Log data from the three wells are considered for verification, of which results show that the S-wave velocity prediction methods help improve the final result. Aided by the DNN-based method, the prediction exhibits a better performance if the training data is sufficient. In particular, provided a small amount of measured S-wave data (even ten data points), the trained DNN model can also provide reasonable predictions. © 2024",2024,2024-08-24 17:23:49,2024-08-26 16:49:12,,,,,240,,,Shear-wave velocity prediction of tight reservoirs based on poroelasticity theory,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,73 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\5IRDD93W\Fang et al. - 2024 - Shear-wave velocity prediction of tight reservoirs.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\FFKG4MQ5\display.html,,,Deep neural network; Rock physics model; Shale oil formation; Shear-wave velocity prediction; Wave propagation equation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These complicated circumstances bring more challenges in identifying accurate first arrivals for the following wave-equation traveltime (WT) inversion. Recently, the autoencoder (AE) is a typical unsupervised learning network, whose basic principle is to compress the input seismic data for their intrinsic features in the latent space with an encoder and, thereafter, to decipher these features for seismic profiles as the output with a decoder. This process is fully automatic with high stability and is not very sensitive to data quality. In this article, we propose an elastic WT inversion algorithm based on the AE method (AEWT) to invert the P -velocity model. Compared with the standard WT, the AEWT method automatically extracts the intrinsic features of the refractions with AE as reference data for the misfit functionals. Feature images in the latent space show similar but intensified sensitivity to the traveltimes with respect to velocity perturbations. We present one synthetic and two field data tests for comparing the proposed AEWT and the standard WT tomograms to investigate the locations of a buried fault and the depth of a buried sinkhole.

Unfortunately, conventional FWI with a least-squares loss function suffers from various drawbacks, such as the local-minima problem and human intervention in the fine-tuning of parameters. It is particular problematic when applied with noisy data and inadequate starting models. Recent work relying on partial differential equations and neural networks show promising performance in two-dimensional FWI. Inspired by the competitive learning of generative adversarial networks, we propose an unsupervised learning paradigm that integrates the wave equation with a discriminative network to accurately estimate physically consistent velocity models in a distributional sense (FWIGAN). The introduced framework does not require a labeled training dataset or pretraining of the network; therefore, this framework is flexible and able to achieve inversion with minimal user interaction. We experimentally validate our method for three baseline geological models, and a comparison of the results demonstrates that FWIGAN faithfully recovers the velocity models and consistently outperforms other traditional or deep learning-based algorithms. A further benefit from the physics-constrained learning used in this method is that FWIGAN mitigates the local-minima issue by reducing the sensitivity to initial models or data noise. © 2023.

However, it requires a great amount of computational resources, which becomes prohibitive when both the modeling domain size and the number of the time samples increase. Therefore, much research has been performed to enhance the computational efficiency of seismic numerical modeling. The expanding domain method is such one technique that improves the computational efficiency by identifying the domain extent where the wave propagation has not reached and excluding these domains from the calculation. In this work, we propose a new deep-learning based method that guide the determination of the computational domain. In order to establish the computational domain where the wave propagates from the snapshots, the deep learning-based object detection was employed. The deep learning object detector used has two main components. The first one is a structure for the feature extraction layers based on ResNet-50. The second one is a structure for the detection of the wave propagation domain based on the You Only Look Once method, version 2 (YOLOv2). After the training, validation and test for the YOLOv2 object detector, the computational efficiency of our proposed method was compared with that of the widely used amplitude comparison-based expanding domain method. It was demonstrated that the computational efficiency of the YOLOv2 method was better when the number of modeling grids was large, and the efficiency in the largest number of grids was about 25.1 %. © 2022 Geophysical Press Ltd.",2022,2024-08-24 17:38:35,2024-08-28 21:45:55,,425-449,,5.0,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,85 - Yes - Forward,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\UQ6AN956\Lee et al. - 2022 - Efficient seismic numerical modelling technique us.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\ANJ9BAGR\display.html,,,computational efficiency; deep learning object detection; expanding domain method; seismic numerical modeling; YOLOv2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This modeling is based upon a wave equation and it depends on a set of parameters of the subsurface. Recent studies have demonstrated that deep learning methods can be trained with seismic data to estimate velocity models that give a representation of the subsurface where the seismic data was generated. Thus, an analysis is made on the impact that different sets of parameters have on the estimation of velocity models by a fully convolutional network (FCN). The experiments varied the number of sources among four options (1, 10, 25 or 50 shots) and used three different ranges of peak frequencies: 4, 8 and 16 Hz. The results demonstrated that, although the number of sources have more influence on the computational time needed to train the FCN than the peak frequency, both changes have significant impact on the quality of the estimation. The best estimations were obtained with the experiment of 25 sources with 4 Hz and increasing the peak frequency to 8 Hz improved even more the results, especially regarding the FCN's loss function. © 2019 by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.",2019,2024-08-24 17:43:28,2024-08-28 23:34:16,,93-98,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,92 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\IXSPFKK9\Campos et al. - 2019 - An empirical analysis of the influence of seismic .pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\33PPBUTQ\display.html,,,Deep Learning; Fully Convolutional Networks; Geophysics; Seismic Data Analysis; Velocity Model Estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WMSCI 2019 - 23rd World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, stability is a prominent concern due to the exponential increase in high-frequency ambient noise during seismic wavefield propagation. The two primary strategies for mitigating instability in Q-RTM are regularization and low-pass filtering. Q-RTM instability can be addressed through regularization. However, determining the appropriate regularization parameters is often an experimental process, leading to challenges in accurately recovering the wavefield. Another approach to control instability is low-pass filtering. Nevertheless, selecting the cutoff frequency for different Q values is a complex task. In situations with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in seismic data, using low-pass filtering can make Q-RTM highly unstable. The need for a small cutoff frequency for stability can result in a significant loss of high-frequency signals. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that leverages data-driven concepts to address the issue of amplitude attenuation in seismic records, particularly when dealing with instability during the Q-RTM (reverse time migration with Q-attenuation) process. Our innovative framework is executed using a convolutional neural network. This network has the capability to both predict and compensate for the missing high-frequency components caused by Q-effects while simultaneously reconstructing the low-frequency information present in seismograms. This approach helps mitigate overwhelming instability phenomena and enhances the overall generalization capacity of the model. Numerical examples demonstrate that our Q-RTM results closely align with the reference images, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed MTL frequency-extension method. This method effectively compensates for the attenuation of high-frequency signals and mitigates the instability issues associated with the traditional Q-RTM process. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2024-08-24 17:44:09,2024-08-26 17:35:17,,,,12.0,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,93 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\52CUKUWF\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\S37IIZR9\Xue et al. - 2023 - A Multi-Task Learning Framework of Stable Q-Compen.pdf,,,deep learning; fractional wave equation; Q-RTM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a layered subsurface, these eigenfunctions provide a framework to calculate guided-wave properties at a fraction of the time required for fully numerical approaches for wave-equation modeling, such as the finite-difference approach. Using a 1D velocity model representing the low-velocity Eagle Ford Shale, an unconventional hydrocarbon reservoir, we verify the accuracy of the displacement eigenfunctions by comparing with finite-difference modeling. We use the amplitude portion of the Green's function for source-receiver eigenfunction pairs as a proxy for expected guided-wave amplitude. These response functions are used to investigate the impact of velocity contrast, reservoir thickness, and receiver depth on guided-wave amplitudes for discrete frequencies. We find that receivers located within the low-velocity zone record larger guided-wave amplitudes. This property may be used to infer the location of the recording array in relation to the low-velocity reservoir. We also study guided-wave energy distribution between the different layers of the Eagle Ford model and find that most of the high-frequency energy is confined to the low-velocity reservoir. We corroborate this measurement with field microseismic data recorded by DAS (distributed acoustic sensing) fiber installed outside of the Eagle Ford. The data contain high-frequency body-wave energy, but the guided waves are confined to low frequencies since the recording array is outside the waveguide. We also study the energy distribution between the fundamental and first guided-wave modes as a function of frequency and source depth and find a nodal point in the first mode for source depths originating in the middle of the low-velocity zone, which we validate with the same field data.

Wave arrival times and wave fronts' propagation are very accurate since 80% of the predictions have an excellent phase GOF. The fluctuations amplitudes are good for 87% of the predictions. The envelope score is hindered by the small-scale fluctuations that are challenging to capture due to the complex physical phenomena associated with high-frequency features. Nevertheless, the MIFNO can generalize to sources located outside the training domain and it shows good generalization ability to a real complex overthrust geology. When focusing on a region of interest, transfer learning improves the accuracy with limited additional costs, since GOF scores improved by more than 1 GOF unit with only 500 additional specific samples. The MIFNO is the first surrogate model offering the flexibility of an earthquake simulator with varying sources and material properties. Its good accuracy and massive speed-up offer new perspectives to replace numerical simulations in many-query problems.",2024-04-15,2024-09-04 19:54:39,2024-09-04 19:55:03,2024-09-04 19:54:39,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,Preprint - 22,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XWEX83JI\Lehmann et al. - 2024 - Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) for.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GHCNY9GA\2404.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Geophysics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2404.10115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is a linearized inversion problem that iteratively minimizes a misfit functional as a function of the model perturbation. The success of the inversion largely depends on our ability to handle large systems of equations given the massive computation costs. The size of the system almost exponentially increases with the demand for higher resolution images in complicated subsurface media. We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach that leverages the existing physics-based models and machine learning optimizers to achieve more accurate and cheaper solutions. We compare different optimizers and demonstrate their efficacy in mitigating imaging artifacts. Further, minimizing the Huber loss with mini-batch gradients and Adam optimizer is not only less memory-intensive but is also more robust. Our empirical results on synthetic, densely sampled datasets suggest faster convergence to an accurate LSRTM result than a traditional approach.",2019-12-09,2024-09-04 19:56:48,2024-09-04 19:57:03,2024-09-04 19:56:48,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,Preprint - 26,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\98SVRXNZ\Vamaraju et al. - 2019 - Accelerating Least Squares Imaging Using Deep Lear.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\FDIZVII6\1911.html,,,Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Image and Video Processing; Physics - Computational Physics; Physics - Geophysics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:1911.06027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.",2024-07-25,2024-09-04 19:57:13,2024-09-04 19:57:58,2024-09-04 19:57:13,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,Preprint - 27,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BVERLUKC\Huang et al. - 2024 - Diffusion-based subsurface multiphysics monitoring.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\G6GPXBWN\2407.html,,,Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Geophysics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2407.18426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
