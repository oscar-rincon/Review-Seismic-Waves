However, the necessity of using large training data and the ‘black box’ nature of learning have limited them in practice and difficult to interpret. Furthermore, including the governing equations and physical facts in such methods is also another challenge, which entails either ignoring the physics or simplifying them using unrealistic data. To address such issues, physics informed machine learning methods have been developed which can integrate the governing physics law into the learning process. In this work, a 1-dimensional (1D) time-dependent seismic wave equation is considered and solved using two methods, namely Gaussian process (GP) and physics informed neural networks. We show that these meshless methods are trained by smaller amount of data and can predict the solution of the equation with even high accuracy. They are also capable of inverting any parameter involved in the governing equation such as wave velocity in our case. Results show that the GP can predict the solution of the seismic wave equation with a lower level of error, while our developed neural network is more accurate for velocity (P- and S-wave) and density inversion.",2020-11-01,2024-02-01 23:38:43,2024-09-02 14:42:41,2024-02-01 23:38:43,1993-2001,,6.0,11,,Geoscience Frontiers,Physics informed machine learning,,,,,,,,,,,,ScienceDirect,,25 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\TLCZRAWN\Karimpouli and Tahmasebi - 2020 - Physics informed machine learning Seismic wave eq.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\L8R35MEI\S1674987120301717.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\PL8KJIBX\S1674987120301717.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\MS77RZSL\display.html,,Gaussian process (GP); Optimization; Physics informed machine learning (PIML); Seismic wave,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this study leverages the inherent connection between the temporal-spatial stepping processes and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as well as convolutional layers (CLs) to propose a general-purpose recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) platform for solving PDEs.

In seismology, it regulates seismic wave traveltimes needed for applications like source localization, imaging, and inversion. Several numerical algorithms have been developed over the years to solve the eikonal equation. However, these methods require considerable modifications to incorporate additional physics, such as anisotropy, and may even breakdown for certain complex forms of the eikonal equation, requiring approximation methods. Moreover, they suffer from computational bottleneck when repeated computations are needed for perturbations in the velocity model and/or the source location, particularly in large 3D models. Here, we propose an algorithm to solve the eikonal equation based on the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). By minimizing a loss function formed by imposing the eikonal equation, we train a neural network to output traveltimes that are consistent with the underlying partial differential equation. We observe sufficiently high traveltime accuracy for most applications of interest. We also demonstrate how the proposed algorithm harnesses machine learning techniques like transfer learning and surrogate modeling to speed up traveltime computations for updated velocity models and source locations. Furthermore, we use a locally adaptive activation function and adaptive weighting of the terms in the loss function to improve convergence rate and solution accuracy. We also show the flexibility of the method in incorporating medium anisotropy and free-surface topography compared to conventional methods that require significant algorithmic modifications. These properties of the proposed PINN eikonal solver are highly desirable in obtaining a flexible and efficient forward modeling engine for seismological applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2024-08-24 16:01:01,2024-08-26 04:40:34,,,,,155,,,PINNeik,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,28 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XXHQGT7M\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\MI57RJ84\Waheed et al. - 2021 - PINNeik Eikonal solution using physics-informed n.pdf,,,Eikonal equation; Physics-informed neural networks; Seismic modeling; Traveltimes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Solving for the frequency-domain scattered wavefield via physics-informed neural network (PINN) has great potential in increasing the flexibility and reducing the computational cost of seismic modeling and inversion. However, when dealing with high-frequency wavefields using PINN, its accuracy and training cost limit its application. Thus, we propose a novel implementation of PINN using frequency upscaling and neuron splitting, which allows the neural network model to grow in size as we increase the frequency while leveraging the information from the pre-trained model for lower-frequency wavefields, resulting in fast convergence to highly accurate wavefield solutions. Numerical results show that, compared to the commonly used PINN with random initialization, the proposed PINN exhibits notable superiority in terms of convergence and accuracy and can achieve neuron based high-frequency wavefield solutions with a shallow model. © 2022.

However, due to the limited wavefield propagation angle, it is difficult to use one-way wave equation-based migration for high-precision imaging of structures with large inclinations due to issues such as inaccurate amplitudes and migration image artifacts. In addition, when the model has large horizontal velocity differences, it is difficult for the one-way wave propagator to calculate an accurate wavefield phase. Reverse time migration (RTM) based on the two-way wave propagator has a high resolution and avoids the issues associated with one-way wave propagators; however, it has a high computational cost in practical applications. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) application mode that improves one migration method by learning from another one and design a CNN with a structure similar to U-net that combines the advantages of both migration methods. The CNN label is the RTM result, and the corresponding input is the result of one-way wave migration with a generalized screen propagator (GSP). The trained CNN model improves the amplitude in the one-way wave migration image and removes the errors caused by large lateral velocity perturbations. Moreover, by maintaining the high migration calculation efficiency, our CNN model allows for a high resolution, few artifacts, and accurate images of steep structures in the one-way wave migration result. With our method, the accuracy of the one-way wave migration result is close to that of the RTM result. The use of GSP-based migration in our CNN model rather than conventional RTM to generate prospecting images can considerably reduce the calculation costs. © 2023 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",2023,2024-08-24 16:07:36,2024-08-26 05:19:03,,WA105-WA114,,1.0,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,34 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\55MBFY4G\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\CU2CLGWQ\Yu et al. - 2023 - Enhancing one-way wave equation-based migration wi.pdf,,,machine learning; high resolution; migration; one way; reverse time migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seismic properties and well-log data are essential to establish wave-propagation models. Specifically, the description of wave dispersion and attenuation under complex geological conditions needs proper lithological and petrophysical information. This complex physical mechanism has to be considered if a traditional modeling approach is adopted. In this sense, machine learning (ML) techniques provide new possibilities for this purpose. We compare two deep-neural-network (DNN)-based wave propagation models. In the first (pure data-driven), a DNN is trained to connect seismic attributes, such as wave velocities, to multivariate functions of rock-physics properties. By training DNNs with different initial parameters, the uncertainty of the proposed method can be quantified. The second method assumes the form of the wave equations. Then, the elastic constants of the constitutive relations are predicted by DNNs. The resulting dynamical equations describe the dispersion and attenuation and wavefield simulations can be performed to obtain more information. On the basis of a test, the two kinds of wave-propagation models yield acceptable estimations of the seismic properties, with the second approach showing a broader application because the DNN is trained without S wave data. The methodologies illustrate that the new wave-propagation model based on ML has high precision and can be general in terms of rheological description. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

To solve a frequency-domain wave equation, we often need to invert the impedance matrix. This results in a dramatic increase in computational cost as the model size increases. It is even a bigger challenge for anisotropic media, where the impedance matrix is far more complex. In addition, the conventional finite-difference method produces numerical dispersion artefacts in solving acoustic wave equations for anisotropic media. To address these issues, we use the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain wavefield solutions for an acoustic wave equation for transversely isotropic (TI) media with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). PINNs utilize the concept of automatic differentiation to calculate their partial derivatives, which are free of numerical dispersion artefacts. Thus, we use the wave equation as a loss function to train a neural network to provide functional solutions to the acoustic VTI form of the wave equation. Instead of predicting the pressure wavefields directly, we solve for the scattered pressure wavefields to avoid dealing with the point-source singularity. We use the spatial coordinates as input data to the network, which outputs the real and imaginary parts of the scattered wavefields and auxiliary function. After training a deep neural network, we can evaluate the wavefield at any point in space almost instantly using this trained neural network without calculating the impedance matrix inverse. We demonstrate these features on a simple 2-D anomaly model and a 2-D layered model.

However, when multiple parameters are updated simultaneously, the gradients of the loss function with respect to these parameters will be coupled together, the effect exacerbate the nonlinear problem. We propose a parametric EFWI method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN-EFWI). The parameters that need to be updated are the weights in the neural network rather than the elastic models. The convolutional kernel in the network can increase spatial correlations of elastic models, which can be regard as a regularization strategy to mitigate local minima issue. Furthermore, the representation also can mitigate the cross-talk between parameters due to the reconstruction of Frechét derivatives by neural networks. Both forward and backward processes are implemented using a time-domain finite-difference solver for elastic wave equation. Numerical examples on overthrust models, fluid saturated models and 2004 BP salt body models demonstrate that CNN-EFWI can partially mitigate the local minima problem and reduce the dependence of inversion on the initial models. Mini-batch configuration is used to speed up the update and achieve fast convergence.

Elastic FWI inverts multicomponent data for P and S-wave velocities and densities. We propose an alternative approach for FWI using a combination of machine learning and the physics of wave propagation. Unlike a conventional supervised machine learning, we do not require known answers to train our network. The multicomponent shot gathers are input to a convolutional neural network (CNNs) based auto encoder whose outputs are used as P-wave, S-wave and density models that are used to compute synthetic seismograms using the stress-velocity formulation of the elastic wave equation. The synthetic data are compared against observed input data and the misfit is estimated. The gradient of the misfit with respect to the velocity model parameters is calculated using the adjoint state method. The adjoint state gradient is then used to update the network weights using the automatic differentiation technique. Once the misfit term converges, the neural network can generate subsurface models consistent with the observed data. We observe that the neural network can capture spatial correlations at different scales and thus can introduce regularization in our inverse problem.

The acoustic wave equation (AWE) is often used for studying wave propagation in both fluids and solids and is crucial for many applications including seismic imaging and inversion and non-destructive testing. Because analytical AWE solutions rarely exist for complex heterogeneous media, methods for generating numerical AWE solutions are very desirable. Traditional numerical solvers require discrete model representations with many restrictions placed on the shape and spacing of grid elements. This work uses a relatively new class of numerical solvers known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that provide a mesh-free alternative for generating AWE solutions using a deep neural-network framework. We encapsulate a time-domain AWE formulation within a loss function that is used to train network parameters. The initial conditions are implemented by enforcing hard constraints on the neural network instead of including them as separate loss-function terms. We also use a Fourier neural network (FNN) to alleviate the spectral bias commonly observed when using fully connected neural network in the conventional PINN approach. Numerical tests on both 2D homogeneous and heterogeneous velocity models confirm the accuracy of our approach. We observe that using FNNs helps in the convergence of AWE solutions especially for heterogeneous models. We compare PINN-based solutions with those computed by the highly accurate conventional pseudo-spectral method, and observe that the normalized energy differences between the two sets of solutions were less than 4% for all numerical tests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,2024-08-24 16:37:18,2024-08-26 15:21:49,,737-751,,5.0,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,54 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\4DQI2I7K\Sethi et al. - 2023 - Hard enforcement of physics-informed neural networ.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\K4Y9AI94\display.html,,,Wave propagation; Neural networks; Acoustic; Physics informed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DSYSSHFM,conferencePaper,2020,"Kumar, A.; Murali, A.; Priyadarshan, A.",Subsurface velocity profiling by application of physics informed neural networks,,,,,,"Subsurface imaging techniques with improved resolution is the industry's pressing challenge. In this paper, we present a novel Machine Learning based data processing method to generate accurate seismic profiles. Through this method, the processing of humongous acoustic data and subsequent inference of subsurface properties is significantly expedited. The work being presented is an application of a recently developed novel class of algorithms called the Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The method has been proven in its efficacy for approximating the solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDE) governing complex physical phenomena and in data-driven discovery of the underlying PDEs such as the Navier-Stokes system. Herein, we have followed a two-stage procedure. Stage one is the accurate prediction of spatiotemporal propagation of a seismic pulse through a simulated domain resembling thesubsurface. For this we developed a simulator to generate vast amounts of virtual seismic data. Dense Deep Neural Networks (DNN) were used to overfit the data so that it approximates the solution to the wave equations. This was followed by the data-driven discovery of local velocities in different reflector layers. In the second stage, we have extended the algorithm to infer the real subsurface velocity profile based on the data collected at receiver positions during an actual seismic survey from Volve, a field on the Norwegian continental shelf. Moreover, we have bench-marked and established the performance of various models in their ability to learn the receiver data obtained from a simulated 2D seismic survey. The results are promising as the network chosen can learn the receiver data with a minimal number of iterations and with near-perfect accuracy. The models were further tested in their ability to represent solutions of the wave equation in the spatiotemporal domain and in their ability to represent the actual subsurface velocity profiles. The novelty of this paper lies in the overlap of a nascent-stage deep learning tool, called PINNs, with seismic data processing to expedite and improvise high-resolution subsurface imaging. For this, various other uncommon developments were done such as that of adapting PINN as a dynamic wave function approximator. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated by the excellent accuracy obtained when validated against the velocity profile from the field as well as the velocity profile from the simulator. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers",2020,2024-08-24 16:42:10,2024-09-02 15:42:31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,60 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\ERYVQ9BN\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two-step dispersion inversion schema is the dominant method used to invert the surface wave data generated by the cross-correlation of ambient noise signals. However, the two-step methods have a 1-D layered model assumption, which does not account for the complex wave propagation. To overcome this limitation, we employ a 2-D wave-equation dispersion (WD) inversion method which reconstructs the subsurface shear (S) velocity model in one step, and elastic wave-equation modeling is used to simulate the subsurface wave propagation. In the WD method, the optimal S velocity model is obtained by minimizing the dispersion curve differences between the observed and predicted surface wave data, which makes WD method less prone to getting stuck to local minima. In our study, the observed Scholte waves are generated by cross-correlating continuous ambient noise signals recorded by each ocean bottom node (OBN) in the 3-D Gorgon OBN survey, Western Australia. For every two OBN lines, the WD method is used to retrieve the 2-D S velocity structure beneath the first line. We then use a robust neural network (NN)-based method to interpolate the inverted 2-D velocity slices to a continuous 3-D velocity model and also generate a corresponding uncertainty model. Moreover, we compared the predicted dispersion curves and waveforms to the observed data, and a robust waveform and dispersion match are observed across all of the Gorgon OBN lines. © 2022 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.",2022,2024-08-24 17:12:44,2024-08-26 15:54:05,,,,12.0,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,61 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\LHS2L83A\Chen y Saygin - 2022 - 3-D S Wave Imaging via Robust Neural Network Inter.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\S9L2NMJK\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If seismic data lack low frequencies, their resolution deteriorates, leading to inaccurate seismic interpretations. To resolve this problem, we developed a low-frequency reconstruction that employs a modified U-Net neural network. To improve the training of the neural network, we generated training data analogous to unseen data, based on the far-field signature as the wavelet source to retain the spectral characteristics of field data. We addressed potential overfitting by generating a large amount of various synthetic data through wave equation-based modelling using a variety of velocity and density models. After synthesising the seismic data, we implemented a filtering method to produce input data with insufficient low frequencies and label data with sufficient low frequencies. The far-field signature plays an important role in the successful reconstruction of low frequencies due to its intrinsic field data features and greater low-frequency information compared to field data alone. We tested the generalisation of the network using unseen synthetic and field data not used in the training stage, and analyzed the results in the time and frequency domains. Although the input data did not retain frequencies below 10 Hz, the trained network predicted low frequencies that were similar to the desired data. We also produced post-stack sections via simple processing to evaluate low-frequency reconstructions produced by our trained network.

Building on the idea of describing seismic wavefields as a superposition of local plane waves, we propose to interpolate seismic data by using a physics informed neural network (PINN). In the proposed framework, two feed-forward neural networks are jointly trained using the local plane wave differential equation as well as the available data as two terms in the objective function: a primary network assisted by positional encoding is tasked with reconstructing the seismic data, whereas an auxiliary, smaller network estimates the associated local slopes. Results on synthetic and field data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling aliased (coarsely sampled) data and data with large gaps. Our method compares favorably against a classic least-squares inversion approach regularized by the local plane-wave equation as well as a PINN-based approach with a single network and precomputed local slopes. We find that introducing a second network to estimate the local slopes, whereas at the same time interpolating the aliased data enhances the overall reconstruction capabilities and convergence behavior of the primary network.

VMB is a key step in geophysical exploration where a model of the subsurface is needed, such as in hydrocarbon exploration for the Oil & Gas industry. The VMB main product is an initial model of the subsurface that is subsequently used in seismic imaging and interpretation workflows. Existing solutions rely on numerical solutions of wave equations, and requires highly demanding computation and the resources of domain experts. In contrast, we propose and implement a novel 3D CNN solution that bypasses these demanding steps, directly producing an accurate subsurface model from recorded seismic data.

Employing the acoustic or elastic wave equation, inversion starts with approximate initial values of subsurface parameters, which are typically updated in iterative fashion. Here, we propose a two-stage unsupervised machine-learning (ML) methodology for efficient and accurate seismic impedance inversion. The first stage utilizes the generalization capability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to produce realistic estimates of the acoustic impedance (AI), whereas the second stage incorporates physics information to generate synthetic data from the subsurface AI distribution. We also add Bayesian layers to the first stage of the network to evaluate the model errors. The proposed probabilistic approach to deep learning allows one to estimate the uncertainty of the inverted parameters, which enhances the interpretability of the model. We apply the algorithm to a poststack data set generated using the CGG Hampson-Russell software. After conducting network training with a sufficient number of data points, the network is applied to the rest of the data to estimate the model parameters.

Due to its large computation cost, most flavors of FWI rely only on the computation of the gradient of the loss function to estimate the update direction, therefore ignoring the contribution of the Hessian. Depending on how much computational expense one can afford, an approximate of the inverse of the Hessian can be calculated and used to speed up the convergence of FWI towards the global (or a plausible local) minimum. Thus, we propose the use of an approximate Gauss-Newton Hessian computed from a linearization of the wave-equation as commonly done in Least-Squares Migration (LSM). More precisely, we rely on the link between the conventional gradient and the gradient obtained from Born modeling this gradient (i.e., obtained by demigration-migration of the migrated image). However, instead of using non-stationary compact filters as commonly done in the literature to approximate the Hessian, we propose to use a deep neural network to directly learn the mapping between the FWI gradient (output) and its Hessian blurred counterpart (input). By doing so, the network learns to act as an approximate inverse Hessian: as such, when the trained network is applied to the FWI gradient, an enhanced update direction is obtained, which is shown to be beneficial for the convergence of FWI. The weights of the trained deblurring network are then transferred to the next FWI iteration to expedite convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a synthetic dataset. © 2023 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.",2023,2024-08-24 17:21:53,2024-09-02 16:03:31,,635-639,,,2023-August,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,71 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\93S9NY5F\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work performs a comparative study of S-wave velocity prediction based on deep neural network (DNN) and RPM for such reservoirs. By employing the poroelasticity equations which are capable of describing elastic wave propagation in the complex reservoirs saturated with viscous fluid, the relation between elastic and petrophysical properties is established with a DNN-based method. This approach quantifies the connection between P-/S-wave velocities and rock properties. On the other hand, we reformulate the traditional Xu-White model by incorporating the decoupled Kuster-Toksöz (K-T) model and the poroelasticity equations with viscoelastic fluid in the modeling process. The variation of pore aspect ratio with depth is also considered to characterize the complex pore structures, which is appropriate for improving the accuracy of prediction. Log data from the three wells are considered for verification, of which results show that the S-wave velocity prediction methods help improve the final result. Aided by the DNN-based method, the prediction exhibits a better performance if the training data is sufficient.

This process is fully automatic with high stability and is not very sensitive to data quality.

Comparing activation functions in solving the Helmholtz equation using physics-informed neural networks,,,,,,"Solving the wave equation numerically constitutes the majority of the computational cost for applications like seismic imaging and full-waveform inversion (FWI). One approach is to solve the frequency-domain Helmholtz equation which allows a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per frequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz solvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these approaches infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high frequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer information gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a bottleneck for applications like FWI. Therefore, recently an approach based on the emerging paradigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve the Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several challenges associated with the conventional algorithms. However, the approach still needs further developments to be fully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence speed, especially in the presence of sharp heterogeneities in the velocity model. Therefore, we study different activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the swish activation function, which we find to yield superior performance compared to the rest. © (2021) by the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers (EAGE)All rights reserved.",2021,2024-08-24 17:34:24,2024-08-28 21:32:45,,5438-5442,,,7,,,IS IT TIME TO SWISH?,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,80 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VFYIDBVV\Al Safwan et al. - 2021 - Is it time to swish Comparing activation function.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NWSJ4DQX\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,82nd EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, first arrivals can be compressed in a low-rank sense with their skeletal features extracted by a well-trained autoencoder. Empirical experiments suggest that the autoencoder's 1× 1 or 2× 1 latent vectors vary continuously with respect to the input seismic data. It is, therefore, reasonable to introduce a misfit functional measuring the discrepancies between the predicted and the observed data in a low-dimensional latent space. The benefit of this approach is that an elaborated autoencoding neural network not only refines intrinsic information hidden in the refractions but also improves the quality of inversion for a reliable background velocity model. Numerical tests on both synthetic and field data demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, especially in recovering the low-to-intermediate wavenumber parts of the subsurface velocity distribution. Comparisons are made with the other three relevant methods, the wave-equation travel-time (WT) inversion, the envelope inversion, and the full waveform inversion (FWI). As expected, the cycle skipping problem is alleviated due to the reduction of dimensions of data space. This method outperforms the envelope inversion in resolution, and it is no worse than WT.

Unfortunately, conventional FWI with a least-squares loss function suffers from various drawbacks, such as the local-minima problem and human intervention in the fine-tuning of parameters. It is particular problematic when applied with noisy data and inadequate starting models. Recent work relying on partial differential equations and neural networks show promising performance in two-dimensional FWI. Inspired by the competitive learning of generative adversarial networks, we propose an unsupervised learning paradigm that integrates the wave equation with a discriminative network to accurately estimate physically consistent velocity models in a distributional sense (FWIGAN). The introduced framework does not require a labeled training dataset or pretraining of the network; therefore, this framework is flexible and able to achieve inversion with minimal user interaction. We experimentally validate our method for three baseline geological models, and a comparison of the results demonstrates that FWIGAN faithfully recovers the velocity models and consistently outperforms other traditional or deep learning-based algorithms.

This method uses the wave-equation inversion kernel to invert the skeletonized data that is automatically learned by an autoencoder. The skeletonised data is a one-dimensional latent-space representation of the seismic trace. However, for a complicated dataset, the decoded waveform could lose some details if the latent space dimension is set to one, which leads to a low-resolution NML tomogram. To mitigate this problem, an autoencoder with a higher dimensional latent space is needed to encode and decode the seismic data. In this paper, we present a wave equation inversion that inverts the multi-dimensional latent variables of an autoencoder for the subsurface velocity model. The multi-variable implicit function theorem is used to determine the perturbation of the multi-dimensional skeletonised data with respect to the velocity perturbations. In this case, each dimension of the latent variable is characterized one gradient and the velocity model is updated by the weighted sum of all these gradients. Numerical results suggest that the multidimensional NML inverted result can achieve a higher resolution in the tomogram compared to the conventional single dimensional NML inversion. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",2020,2024-08-24 17:38:08,2024-08-26 17:23:45,,1691-1694,,,2020-October,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,84 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\UTM9WKE4\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\JY8HQM28\Chen et al. - 2020 - Seismic inversion by multi-dimensional newtonian m.pdf,,,Machine learning; Inversion; Wave equation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72CC7KQQ,journalArticle,2022,"Lee, D.; Choi, S.; Lee, J.; Chung, W.",Efficient seismic numerical modelling technique using the YOLOv2-based expanding domain method,Journal of Seismic Exploration,,,,,"Wave equation-based seismic modeling has the advantage of simulating the exact full-wave propagation. However, it requires a great amount of computational resources, which becomes prohibitive when both the modeling domain size and the number of the time samples increase. Therefore, much research has been performed to enhance the computational efficiency of seismic numerical modeling. The expanding domain method is such one technique that improves the computational efficiency by identifying the domain extent where the wave propagation has not reached and excluding these domains from the calculation. In this work, we propose a new deep-learning based method that guide the determination of the computational domain. In order to establish the computational domain where the wave propagates from the snapshots, the deep learning-based object detection was employed. The deep learning object detector used has two main components. The first one is a structure for the feature extraction layers based on ResNet-50. The second one is a structure for the detection of the wave propagation domain based on the You Only Look Once method, version 2 (YOLOv2). After the training, validation and test for the YOLOv2 object detector, the computational efficiency of our proposed method was compared with that of the widely used amplitude comparison-based expanding domain method. It was demonstrated that the computational efficiency of the YOLOv2 method was better when the number of modeling grids was large, and the efficiency in the largest number of grids was about 25.1 %. © 2022 Geophysical Press Ltd.",2022,2024-08-24 17:38:35,2024-08-28 21:45:55,,425-449,,5.0,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,85 - Yes - Forward,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\UQ6AN956\Lee et al. - 2022 - Efficient seismic numerical modelling technique us.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\ANJ9BAGR\display.html,,,computational efficiency; deep learning object detection; expanding domain method; seismic numerical modeling; YOLOv2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This modeling is based upon a wave equation and it depends on a set of parameters of the subsurface. Recent studies have demonstrated that deep learning methods can be trained with seismic data to estimate velocity models that give a representation of the subsurface where the seismic data was generated. Thus, an analysis is made on the impact that different sets of parameters have on the estimation of velocity models by a fully convolutional network (FCN). The experiments varied the number of sources among four options (1, 10, 25 or 50 shots) and used three different ranges of peak frequencies: 4, 8 and 16 Hz. The results demonstrated that, although the number of sources have more influence on the computational time needed to train the FCN than the peak frequency, both changes have significant impact on the quality of the estimation. The best estimations were obtained with the experiment of 25 sources with 4 Hz and increasing the peak frequency to 8 Hz improved even more the results, especially regarding the FCN's loss function. © 2019 by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.",2019,2024-08-24 17:43:28,2024-08-28 23:34:16,,93-98,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,92 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\IXSPFKK9\Campos et al. - 2019 - An empirical analysis of the influence of seismic .pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\33PPBUTQ\display.html,,,Geophysics; Deep Learning; Fully Convolutional Networks; Seismic Data Analysis; Velocity Model Estimation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"WMSCI 2019 - 23rd World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, stability is a prominent concern due to the exponential increase in high-frequency ambient noise during seismic wavefield propagation. The two primary strategies for mitigating instability in Q-RTM are regularization and low-pass filtering. Q-RTM instability can be addressed through regularization. However, determining the appropriate regularization parameters is often an experimental process, leading to challenges in accurately recovering the wavefield. Another approach to control instability is low-pass filtering. Nevertheless, selecting the cutoff frequency for different Q values is a complex task. In situations with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in seismic data, using low-pass filtering can make Q-RTM highly unstable. The need for a small cutoff frequency for stability can result in a significant loss of high-frequency signals. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that leverages data-driven concepts to address the issue of amplitude attenuation in seismic records, particularly when dealing with instability during the Q-RTM (reverse time migration with Q-attenuation) process. Our innovative framework is executed using a convolutional neural network. This network has the capability to both predict and compensate for the missing high-frequency components caused by Q-effects while simultaneously reconstructing the low-frequency information present in seismograms. This approach helps mitigate overwhelming instability phenomena and enhances the overall generalization capacity of the model. Numerical examples demonstrate that our Q-RTM results closely align with the reference images, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed MTL frequency-extension method. This method effectively compensates for the attenuation of high-frequency signals and mitigates the instability issues associated with the traditional Q-RTM process. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2024-08-24 17:44:09,2024-08-26 17:35:17,,,,12.0,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,93 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\52CUKUWF\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\S37IIZR9\Xue et al. - 2023 - A Multi-Task Learning Framework of Stable Q-Compen.pdf,,,deep learning; fractional wave equation; Q-RTM,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inaccuracies in this decomposition can result in migration images with biased amplitudes and undesirable crosstalk artifacts. Although vector decomposition (VD) methods are effective, they rely on the availability of elastic parameters at the acquisition surface. Therefore, we propose a data-driven deep-learning (DL)-P/S-VD method that eliminates the need for prior elastic parameter information. We used publicly available elastic models to generate training datasets by simulating multicomponent data and their amplitude-preserving P-/S-wave components using the decoupled elastic wave equation. Our analysis explores the impact of the loss function type, output channel quantity, and direct wave removal on the generalization ability of DL-PSVD. The critical insights from the numerical experiments include the superior generalization ability of DL-PSVD using two channels when the P-/S-wave energy distribution is highly unbalanced. Moreover, DL-PSVD exhibits improved generalization ability using four channels for observed data with removed direct waves. Finally, the L1 loss function is more effective for DL-PSVD's generalization ability than the L2 loss function.

The rise of Deep Learning, which is based on matrix multiplications, accelerated this path, especially in terms of single precision and lower precision computation. An important research question is if this development can be leveraged for traditional HPC. In this work we demonstrate that a high order discontinuous Galerkin solver for seismic wave propagation can execute in single precision without loss of modeling accuracy. Additionally, we extended its kernels to support the Intel Knights Mill CPU with 14 TFLOPS of tensor-optimized single precision performance. This allows us to exploit the hardware's special computation capabilities, even in a regular HPC application with sparse linear algebra kernels. At the cluster-level, Knights Mill can obtain the same application performance as the latest top-bin dual socket Intel Xeon Platinum nodes. Compared to the HPC-focused Knights Landing processor, speed-ups of up to 1.6 × are possible, depending on the configuration of the solver.

Traditional inversion methods from field-recorded seismograms struggle in regions with complex geology. While deep learning (DL) presents a promising alternative, its robustness using field data in these complicated regions has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we present a thorough analysis of DL’s capability to harness labeled seismograms, whether field-recorded or synthetically generated, for accurate velocity model recovery in a challenging region of the Gulf of Mexico. Our evaluation centers on the impact of training data selection and data augmentation techniques on the DL model’s ability to recover velocity profiles. Models trained on field data produced superior results to data obtained using quantitative metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), and (Formula presented.) (R-squared). They also yielded more geologically plausible predictions and sharper geophysical migration images. Conversely, models trained on synthetic data, while less precise, highlighted the potential utility of synthetic training data, especially when labeled field data are scarce. Our work shows that the efficacy of synthetic data-driven models largely depends on bridging the domain gap between training and test data through the use of advanced wave equation solvers and geologic priors. Our results underscore DL’s potential to advance velocity model-building workflows in industrial settings using previously labeled field-recorded seismograms. They also highlight the indispensable role of earth scientists’ domain expertise in curating synthetic data when field data are lacking. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2024-08-28 15:42:25,2024-09-02 16:54:26,,,,19.0,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,99 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VGF6MCFD\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\7QTDI4MX\Farris et al. - 2023 - Learning-Based Seismic Velocity Inversion with Syn.pdf,,,deep learning; inverse problems; field data; seismic propagation velocity; synthetic training data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a layered subsurface, these eigenfunctions provide a framework to calculate guided-wave properties at a fraction of the time required for fully numerical approaches for wave-equation modeling, such as the finite-difference approach. Using a 1D velocity model representing the low-velocity Eagle Ford Shale, an unconventional hydrocarbon reservoir, we verify the accuracy of the displacement eigenfunctions by comparing with finite-difference modeling. We use the amplitude portion of the Green's function for source-receiver eigenfunction pairs as a proxy for expected guided-wave amplitude. These response functions are used to investigate the impact of velocity contrast, reservoir thickness, and receiver depth on guided-wave amplitudes for discrete frequencies. We find that receivers located within the low-velocity zone record larger guided-wave amplitudes. This property may be used to infer the location of the recording array in relation to the low-velocity reservoir. We also study guided-wave energy distribution between the different layers of the Eagle Ford model and find that most of the high-frequency energy is confined to the low-velocity reservoir. We corroborate this measurement with field microseismic data recorded by DAS (distributed acoustic sensing) fiber installed outside of the Eagle Ford. The data contain high-frequency body-wave energy, but the guided waves are confined to low frequencies since the recording array is outside the waveguide. We also study the energy distribution between the fundamental and first guided-wave modes as a function of frequency and source depth and find a nodal point in the first mode for source depths originating in the middle of the low-velocity zone, which we validate with the same field data. The varying modal energy distribution can provide useful constraints for microseismic event depth estimation. © 2021 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",2021,2024-08-28 15:50:00,2024-09-02 17:08:57,,,,6.0,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,105 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3JV8AYFH\Huff et al. - 2021 - An Eigenfunction Representation of Deep Waveguides.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\Z53DDUKG\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use a spectral element (SEM) seismic propagator to simulate the propagation of the Scholte waves on the irregular bathymetry, and to calculate the model updates. Technically the workflow consists of two components: dispersion curve picking using a machine learning (ML)-based method and dispersion curve inversion.

MGMQWGND,conferencePaper,2018,"Ma, J.; Yu",Deep learning for attenuating random and coherence noise simultaneously,,,,,,"""We introduce deep learning (DL) to three kinds of seismic noise attenuation: random noise, linear noise and multiple. Compared to the traditional seismic noise attenuation algorithms that depend on signal models and corresponding prior assumptions, a deep neural network is trained based on a huge training set, where the inputs are the raw datasets and the corresponding outputs are the desired clean data. Moreover, DL handles three kinds of noise simultaneously instead of sequentially. The DL method achieves satisfying denoising quality with no requirements of (i) accurate modeling of the signal and noise; (ii) optimal parameters tuning. We call it intelligent denoising. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the basic tool for DL and the training set is generated with wave equation for the multiple, and then manually adding random and linear noise. Stochastic gradient descent is used to solve the optimal parameters for the CNN.
