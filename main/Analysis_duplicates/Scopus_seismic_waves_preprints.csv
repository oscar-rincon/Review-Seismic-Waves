However, coordinate-based neural networks (NNs) commonly suffer from the ""spectral bias"" pathology, which greatly limits their ability to model high-frequency wave propagation in sharp and complex media. We propose a unified framework of Fourier feature physics-informed neural networks (FF-PINNs) for solving the time-domain wave equations. The proposed framework combines the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) strategy with a pre-trained wave velocity surrogate model to mitigate the singularity at the point source. The performance of the activation functions and gradient descent strategies are discussed through ablation experiments. In addition, we evaluate the accuracy comparison of Fourier feature mappings sampled from different families of distributions (Gaussian, Laplace, and uniform). The second-order paraxial approximation-based boundary conditions are incorporated into the loss function as a soft regularizer to eliminate spurious boundary reflections. Through the non-smooth Marmousi and Overthrust model cases, we emphasized the necessity of the absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) constraints. The results of a series of numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method for modeling high-frequency wave propagation in sharp and complex media.","2024-07-23","2024-09-04 19:13:59","2024-09-04 19:14:31","2024-09-04 19:13:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","Social Science Research Network","","Preprint - 1","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\YWC6ZVSP\Ding et al. - 2024 - Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier Feat.pdf","","","Absorbing boundary conditions; Fourier feature neural networks; Physics-informed neural networks; Seismic wave propagation simulation; Spectral bias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4902158","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recently proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep learning method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients are non-smooth and describe structurally-complex media. In this paper, we solve the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field wave equation in the frequency domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove source singularity. We first illustrate that non-smooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function of PINN and design a quadratic neural network to overcome the detrimental effects of non-smooth models in PINN. We show that PML and quadratic neurons improve the results as well as attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We also illustrate that a network trained during a wavefield simulation can be used to pre-train the neural network of another wavefield simulation after PDE-coefficient alteration and improve the convergence speed accordingly. This pre-training strategy should find application in iterative full waveform inversion (FWI) and time-lag target-oriented imaging when the model perturbation between two consecutive iterations or two consecutive experiments can be small.","2022-09-27","2024-09-04 19:14:47","2024-09-04 19:15:11","2024-09-04 19:14:47","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Preprint - 2","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\TN3CX3YH\Wu et al. - 2022 - Wave simulation in non-smooth media by PINN with q.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\7ADNSU4W\2208.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2208.08276","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The advancement of deep learning enables solving partial differential equations, including wave equations, by applying neural networks to identify the mapping between the inputs and the solution. This approach can be faster than traditional numerical methods when numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted in practice. Instead, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models. We also propose a new framework paralleled Fourier neural operator (PFNO) for efficiently training the FNO-based solver given multiple source locations and frequencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to out-of-distribution velocity models. Moreover, PFNO has robust performance in the presence of random noise in the labels. Finally, PFNO admits higher computational efficiency on large-scale testing datasets than the traditional finite-difference method.

In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Data is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on FGA data, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method.

With neural operators, one can learn the general solution of Partial Differential Equations, such as the elastic wave equation, with varying parameters. There have been very few applications of neural operators in seismology. All of them were limited to two-dimensional settings, although the importance of three-dimensional (3D) effects is well known.

We used a high-fidelity simulation code, SEM3D, to build an extensive database of ground motions generated by 30,000 different geologies. With this database, we show that the FNO can produce accurate ground motion even when the underlying geology exhibits large heterogeneities. Intensity measures at moderate and large periods are especially well reproduced. We present the first seismological application of Fourier Neural Operators in 3D.

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder is the recorded common shot gathers, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. Empirical results suggest that the cycle-skipping problem is largely mitigated compared to the conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) method by replacing the waveform differences by those of the latent-space parameters. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The most significant contribution of this paper is that it provides a general framework for using solutions to the governing PDE to invert skeletal data generated by any type of a neural network. The governing equation can be that for gravity, seismic waves, electromagnetic fields, and magnetic fields. The input data can be the records from different types of data and their skeletal features, as long as the model parameters are sensitive to their perturbations. The skeletal data can be the latent space variables of an autoencoder, a variational autoencoder, or a feature map from a convolutional neural network (CNN), or principal component analysis (PCA) features.

In the proposed framework, two feed-forward neural networks are jointly trained using the local plane wave differential equation as well as the available data as two terms in the objective function: a primary network assisted by positional encoding is tasked with reconstructing the seismic data, whilst an auxiliary, smaller network estimates the associated local slopes. Results on synthetic and field data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling aliased (coarsely sampled) data and data with large gaps. Our method compares favorably against a classic least-squares inversion approach regularized by the local plane-wave equation as well as a PINN-based approach with a single network and pre-computed local slopes. We find that introducing a second network to estimate the local slopes whilst at the same time interpolating the aliased data enhances the overall reconstruction capabilities and convergence behavior of the primary network.

Due to its large computation cost, most flavors of FWI rely only on the computation of the gradient of the loss function to estimate the update direction, therefore ignoring the contribution of the Hessian. Depending on the level of computational resources one can afford, an approximate of the inverse of the Hessian can be calculated and used to speed up the convergence of FWI towards the global (or a plausible local) minimum. In this work, we propose to use an approximate Hessian computed from a linearization of the wave-equation as commonly done in Least-Squares Migration (LSM). More precisely, we rely on the link between a migrated image and a doubly migrated image (i.e., an image obtained by demigration-migration of the migrated image) to estimate the inverse of the Hessian. However, instead of using non-stationary compact filters to link the two images and approximate the Hessian, we propose to use a deep neural network to directly learn the mapping between the FWI gradient (output) and its Hessian (blurred) counterpart (input). By doing so, the network learns to act as an approximate inverse Hessian: as such, when the trained network is applied to the FWI gradient, an enhanced update direction is obtained, which is shown to be beneficial for the convergence of FWI. The weights of the trained (deblurring) network are then transferred to the next FWI iteration to expedite convergence.

An alternative approach is to solve the frequency domain Helmholtz equation, since it offers a reduction in dimensionality as it can be solved per frequency. However, computational challenges with the classical Helmholtz solvers such as the need to invert a large stiffness matrix can make these approaches computationally infeasible for large 3D models or for modeling high frequencies. Moreover, these methods do not have a mechanism to transfer information gained from solving one problem to the next. This becomes a bottleneck for applications like full waveform inversion where repeated modeling is necessary. Therefore, recently a new approach based on the emerging paradigm of physics informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed to solve the Helmholtz equation. The method has shown promise in addressing several challenging associated with the conventional algorithms, including flexibility to model additional physics and the use of transfer learning to speed up computations. However, the approach still needs further developments to be fully practicable. Foremost amongst the challenges is the slow convergence speed and reduced accuracy, especially in presence of sharp heterogeneities in the velocity model. Therefore, with an eye on exploring how improved convergence can be obtained for the PINN Helmholtz solvers, we study different activation functions routinely used in the PINN literature, in addition to the swish activation function - a variant of ReLU that has shown improved performance on a number of data science problems.

We develop a scheme to train Neural Operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As Neural Operators are grid-free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method's applicability to seismic tomography, using reverse mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The developed procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using conventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.","2021-10-13","2024-09-04 19:47:34","2024-09-04 20:18:12","2024-09-04 19:47:34","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Preprint - 14 - duplicated","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\LHMDXJDK\Yang et al. - 2021 - Seismic wave propagation and inversion with Neural.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\T9843ZMY\2108.html","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2108.05421","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uncertainties exist in data measurements, source positioning, and subsurface geophysical properties. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a high-resolution depth migration approach useful for extracting information such as reservoir localization and boundaries. RTM, however, is time-consuming and data-intensive as it requires computing twice the wave equation to generate and store an imaging condition. RTM, when embedded in an uncertainty quantification algorithm (like the Monte Carlo method), shows a many-fold increase in its computational complexity due to the high input-output dimensionality. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder deep learning surrogate model for RTM under uncertainty. Inputs are an ensemble of velocity fields, expressing the uncertainty, and outputs the seismic images.

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion (FWI). However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the neural network (NN) a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source on the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application.

The DL feature is a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional seismic data, which is automatically generated by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and preserved in the latent space. The low-dimensional DL feature contains the key information of the input seismic data. Therefore, instead of directly comparing the waveform differences between the observed and predicted data, such as full-waveform inversion (FWI). We measure their DL feature differences in the latent space of a CAE. The advantage of this low-dimensional comparison is that it is less prone to the cycle-skipping problem compared to FWI. The reason is that the DL features mainly contain the kinematic information, such as traveltime, of the input seismic data when the latent space dimension is small. However, more dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, can be preserved in the DL feature when the latent space dimension becomes larger. Therefore we propose a multiscale inversion approach that starts with inverting the low-dimensional DL features for the low-wavenumber information of the subsurface model. Then recover its high-wavenumber details through inverting the high-dimensional DL features. However, there is no governing equation that contains both the velocity and DL feature terms in the same equation. Therefore we use the automatic differentiation (AD) to numerically connect the perturbation of DL features to the velocity perturbation. In another word, we connect a deep learning network with the wave-equation inversion by using the AD. We denote this hybrid connection as hybrid machine learning (HML) inversion. Here, the AD replaces the complex math derivations of the gradient with a black box so anyone can do HML without having a deep geophysical background.","2021-09","2024-09-04 19:52:10","2024-09-04 20:08:35","2024-09-04 19:52:10","e2020JB021589","","9","126","","JGR Solid Earth","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Preprint - 20 - duplicated","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\MNBE3N6P\Chen y Saygin - 2021 - Seismic Inversion by Hybrid Machine Learning.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\F3V2AA9E\2009.html","","","Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is particularly problematic for full waveform inversion, which typically involves numerous runs of the forward process. In machine learning there has been considerable recent work in the area of operator learning, with a new class of models called neural operators allowing for data-driven solutions to partial differential equations. Recent works in seismology have shown that when neural operators are adequately trained, they can significantly shorten the compute time for wave propagation. However, the memory required for the 3D time domain equations may be prohibitive. In this study, we show that these limitations can be overcome by solving the wave equations in the frequency domain, also known as the Helmholtz equations, since the solutions for a set of frequencies can be determined in parallel. The 3D Helmholtz neural operator is 40 times more memory-efficient than an equivalent time-domain version. We employ a U-shaped neural operator for 2D and 3D elastic wave modeling, achieving two orders of magnitude acceleration compared to a baseline spectral element method. The neural operator accurately generalizes to variable velocity structures and can be evaluated on denser input meshes than used in the training simulations. We also show that when solving for wavefields strictly on the surface, the accuracy can be significantly improved via a graph neural operator layer. In leveraging automatic differentiation, the proposed method can serve as an alternative to the adjoint-state approach for 3D full-waveform inversion, reducing the computation time by a factor of 350.","2023-11-16","2024-09-04 19:52:43","2024-09-04 19:54:28","2024-09-04 19:52:43","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Preprint - 21","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3ZLHGKCL\Zou et al. - 2023 - Deep Neural Helmholtz Operators for 3D Elastic Wav.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\GRW58A47\2311.html","","","Physics - Geophysics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2311.09608","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work introduces the Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) to deal with structured 3D fields representing material properties as well as vectors describing the source characteristics. The MIFNO is applied to the problem of elastic wave propagation in the Earth's crust. It is trained on the HEMEW^S-3D database containing 30000 earthquake simulations in different heterogeneous domains with random source positions and orientations. Outputs are time- and space-dependent surface wavefields. The MIFNO predictions are assessed as good to excellent based on Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) criteria. Wave arrival times and wave fronts' propagation are very accurate since 80% of the predictions have an excellent phase GOF. The fluctuations amplitudes are good for 87% of the predictions. The envelope score is hindered by the small-scale fluctuations that are challenging to capture due to the complex physical phenomena associated with high-frequency features. Nevertheless, the MIFNO can generalize to sources located outside the training domain and it shows good generalization ability to a real complex overthrust geology. When focusing on a region of interest, transfer learning improves the accuracy with limited additional costs, since GOF scores improved by more than 1 GOF unit with only 500 additional specific samples.

The single-dimensional LS features mainly contain the kinematic information of the seismic data, which are automatically extracted from the seismic signal by using an autoencoder network. Because its LS feature dimension is too small to preserve the dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, of the seismic data. Therefore the NML inversion is not able to recover the high-wavenumber velocity details. To mitigate this problem, we propose to invert multi-dimensional LS features, which can fully represent the entire characters of the seismic data. We denote this method as multi-dimensional Newtonian machine learning (MNML). In MNML, we define a new multi-variable connective function that works together with the multi-variable implicit function theorem to connect the velocity perturbations to the multi-dimensional LS feature perturbations. Numerical tests show that (1) the multi-dimensional LS features can preserve more data information than the single-dimensional LS features; (2) a higher resolution velocity model can be recovered by inverting the multi-dimensional LS features, and the inversion quality is comparable to that of FWI; (3) the MNML method requires a much smaller storage space than conventional FWI because only the low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional seismic data are needed to be stored.

In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources.
