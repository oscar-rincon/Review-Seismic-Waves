In this study, we present an algorithm for PINNs applied to the acoustic wave equation and test the method with both forward models and FWI case studies. These synthetic case studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point sources. PINNs' meshless formalism allows for a flexible implementation of the wave equation and different types of boundary conditions. For instance, our models demonstrate that PINN automatically satisfies absorbing boundary conditions, a serious computational challenge for common wave propagation solvers. Furthermore, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure can be seamlessly encoded in PINNs' formulation. We find that the current state‐of‐the‐art PINNs provide good results for the forward model, even though spectral element or finite difference methods are more efficient and accurate. More importantly, our results demonstrate that PINNs yield excellent results for inversions on all cases considered and with limited computational complexity. We discuss the current limitations of the method with complex velocity models as well as strategies to overcome these challenges. Using PINNs as a geophysical inversion solver offers exciting perspectives, not only for the full waveform seismic inversions, but also when dealing with other geophysical datasets (e.g., MT, gravity) as well as joint inversions because of its robust framework and simple implementation.",2022-04-27,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-04 00:12:45,,,,5,127.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Wiley,,,,Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Full-Waveform Tomography; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost.",2020-01-01,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,112266-112277,,,8.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,,,,Earthquake Detection; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we utilize a recently introduced machine-learning based framework called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the frequency-domain wave equation, which is also referred to as the Helmholtz equation, for isotropic and anisotropic media. Like functions, PINNs are formed by using a fully connected neural network (NN) to provide the wavefield solution at spatial points in the domain of interest, in which the coordinates of the point form the input to the network. We train such a network by backpropagating the misfit in the wave equation for the output wavefield values and their derivatives for many points in the model space. Generally, a hyperbolic tangent activation is used with PINNs, however, we use an adaptive sinusoidal activation function to optimize the training process. Numerical results show that PINNs with adaptive sinusoidal activation functions are able to generate frequency-domain wavefield solutions that satisfy wave equations. We also show the flexibility and versatility of the proposed method for various media, including anisotropy, and for models with strong irregular topography.",2021-10-23,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,1750-1762,,3,228.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Oxford University Press,,,,Acoustic wave equation; Activation function; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Wave Equation Migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is exacerbated by the fact that new simulations must be performed whenever the velocity structure or source location is perturbed. Here, we explore a prototype framework for learning general solutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called neural operator. A trained neural operator can compute a solution in negligible time for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As neural operators are grid free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method’s applicability to seismic tomography, using reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The developed procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using conventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.",2021-10-01,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,126-134,,3,1.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,Acoustic wave equation; Ambient Seismic; Operator (biology); Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Noise; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wave Equation Migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder consists of seismic traces, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the Fréchet derivative, i.e., the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The gradient is computed by migrating the shifted observed traces weighted by the skeletonized data residual, and the final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. We denote this as inversion by Newtonian machine learning (NML) because it inverts for the model parameters by combining the forward and backward modeling of Newtonian wave propagation with the dimensional reduction capability of machine learning. Empirical results suggest that inversion by NML can sometimes mitigate the cycle-skipping problem of conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI). Numerical tests with synthetic and field data demonstrate the success of NML inversion in recovering a low-wavenumber approximation to the subsurface velocity model. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The disadvantage is that the inverted velocity model has less resolution compared with the FWI result, but it can serve as a good initial model for FWI. Our most significant contribution is that we provide a general framework for using wave-equation inversion to invert skeletal data generated by any type of neural network. In other words, we have combined the deterministic modeling of Newtonian physics and the pattern matching capabilities of machine learning to invert seismic data by NML.",2020-06-10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,WA185-WA200,,4,85.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Society of Exploration Geophysicists,,,,Autoencoder; Inversion; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Synthetic data; Wave Equation Migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion. However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network (NN) parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the NN with a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source at the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach.",2021-12-01,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,11-19,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier BV,,,,Acoustic wave equation; Helmholtz equation; Helmholtz free energy; Wave Equation Migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the diffraction energy tends to be weak compared to the reflected energy and is also sensitive to inaccuracies in the migration velocity, making the identification of its signal challenging. In this work, we present an innovative workflow to automatically detect scattering points in the migration dip angle domain using deep learning. By taking advantage of the different kinematic properties of reflected and diffracted waves, we separate the two types of signals by migrating the seismic amplitudes to dip angle gathers using prestack depth imaging in the local angle domain. Convolutional neural networks are a class of deep learning algorithms able to learn to extract spatial information about the data in order to identify its characteristics. They have now become the method of choice to solve supervised pattern recognition problems. In this work, we use wave equation modelling to create a large and diversified dataset of synthetic examples to train a network into identifying the probable position of scattering objects in the subsurface. After giving an intuitive introduction to diffraction imaging and deep learning and discussing some of the pitfalls of the methods, we evaluate the trained network on field data and demonstrate the validity and good generalization performance of our algorithm. We successfully identify with a high‐accuracy and high‐resolution diffraction points, including those which have a low signal to noise and reflection ratio.

The monofrequency equation has the form of a Helmholtz equation. When solving the Helmholtz equation for seismic wavefields with multiple frequencies, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) can be used. However, the PINN suffers from the problem of spectral bias when approximating high-frequency components. We propose to simulate seismic multifrequency wavefields using a PINN with an embedded Fourier feature.

We use a U-shaped neural operator to learn a general solution operator to the 2D elastic wave equation from an ensemble of numerical simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations.

The total cost strictly depends on the number of frequency components that are considered, if using a finite-difference method. For the applications such as seismic imaging and inversion, high-frequency information is always required and thus the wave simulation is always a challenging task as it demands tremendous computational cost for obtaining dispersion-free high-frequency wavefields for large subsurface models. This paper demonstrates that a data-driven machine learning method, called the Fourier neural operator (FNO), is capable of predicting high-frequency wavefields, based on a limited number of low-frequency components. As the FNO method is for the first time applied to seismic wavefield extrapolation, the experiment reveals three attractive features with FNO: high efficiency, high accuracy and, importantly, the predicted high-frequency wavefields are dispersion free.",2022-04-01,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,269-282,,2,19.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: IOP Publishing,,,,Operator (biology); Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wavenumber,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thousands of such forward simulations are often a routine requirement for parameter estimation of microseimsic events via a suitable source inversion process. Parameter estimation based on forward modelling is often advantageous over a direct regression-based inversion approach when there are unknown number of parameters to be estimated and the seismic data have complicated noise characteristics which may not always allow a stable and unique solution in a direct inversion process. In this paper, starting from Graphics Processing Unit based synthetic simulations of a few thousand forward seismic shots due to microseismic events via pseudo-spectral solution of elastic wave equation, we develop a step-by-step process to generate a surrogate regression modelling framework, using machine learning techniques that can produce accurate seismograms at specified receiver locations. The trained surrogate models can then be used as a high-speed meta-model/emulator or proxy for the original full elastic wave propagator to generate seismic responses for other microseismic event locations also. The accuracies of the surrogate models have been evaluated using two independent sets of training and testing Latin hypercube quasi-random samples, drawn from a heterogeneous marine velocity model. The predicted seismograms have been used thereafter to calculate batch likelihood functions, with specified noise characteristics. Finally, the trained models on 23 receivers placed at the sea-bed in a marine velocity model are used to determine the maximum likelihood estimate of the event locations which can in future be used in a Bayesian analysis for microseismic event detection.",2018-07-19,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,1257-1290,,2,215.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Oxford University Press,,,,Microseism; Microseisms; Production Forecasting; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Seismogram; Synthetic seismogram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LS features are the effective low‐dimensional representation of the high‐dimensional seismic data. However, no equations exist to describe the relationship between the perturbation of an LS feature and the velocity perturbation. To address this problem, we use automatic differentiation (AD) to connect the two terms. Following this step, we use the wave‐equation inversion to invert the LS features for the subsurface velocity model. The HML misfit function measures the LS feature differences between the observed and predicted seismic data in a low‐dimensional space, which is less affected by the cycle‐skipping problem compared to the waveform mismatch in a high‐dimensional space. A low dimensional LS feature mainly contains the kinematic information of seismic data, while a large dimensional LS feature can also preserve the dynamic information of seismic data. Therefore, the HML inversion can recover the subsurface velocity model in a multiscale approach by inverting the LS features with different dimensions. Based on the different ways of utilizing AD to compute the velocity gradient, we propose full‐ and semi‐automatic approaches to solve this problem. These two approaches are mathematically equivalent; the former is easier to implement, while the latter is computationally more efficient. Numerical tests show that the HML inversion method can effectively recover both the low‐ and high‐wavenumber velocity information by inverting the LS features with different dimensions.",2021-09-01,2024-09-03 21:52:10,2024-09-03 21:52:10,,,,9,126.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Wiley,,,,Ambient Seismic; Autoencoder; Feature (linguistics); Feature vector; Inverse Problems; Inversion; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Wavenumber,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drill-string dynamics are represented by a distributed dynamical model (wave equations) coupled with an ordinary differential equation at the downhole boundary (bit-rock interaction). The interaction between the drill-bit and rock can introduce severe vibrations in the drill-string and result in safety and performance issues. Consequently, the performance of drilling is interwoven with our knowledge of the subsurface. To address these problems, we propose a sensing and computational framework for estimating the drill-string dynamics and the specific intrinsic energy of the rocks while drilling. By exploiting the derived models' particular structure, we combine the drill-string dynamics modeling with top-drive hook-load (force) and hook-speed (velocity) measurements to estimate the force-on-bit without requiring the knowledge of the sub-surface. Then, we record and model the seismic radiation patterns of drill-bit rock interactions near the surface (i.e., seismic while drilling). Such an idea allows deriving an appropriate estimation of the rocks' intrinsic energy while drilling. We introduce two alternative rock property estimation algorithms based on direct parameter estimation and machine learning concepts to complete the analysis. The different approaches are tested and validated in simulations. We discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks.

In recent years, the advancement of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and by incorporating the causal information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated. Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures.",2023-12-16,2024-09-03 21:52:11,2024-09-03 21:52:11,,13312-13312,,24,13.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,,,Acoustic wave equation; Ambient Seismic; Interpretability; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Noise; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Slowness; Wave Equation Migration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inferring the joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and source location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the inference process requires forward modelling of microseismic traces for each set of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference very computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process. We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on Gaussian Processes to invert microseismic events. We show that all of our models provide more accurate predictions and $\sim 100$ times faster predictions than the method based on Gaussian Processes, and a $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform generation. For example, a 2-s long synthetic trace can be generated in $\sim 10$ ms on a common laptop processor, instead of $\sim$ 1 hr using a pseudo-spectral method on a high-profile Graphics Processing Units card. We also show that our inference results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from traditional location methods based on travel time estimates. The speed, accuracy and scalability of our open source deep learning models pave the way for extensions of these emulators to generic source mechanisms and application to joint Bayesian inversion of moment tensor components and source location using full waveforms.",2021-07-29,2024-09-03 21:52:11,2024-09-03 21:52:11,,1683-1705,,7,12.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Copernicus Publications,,,,Deep Learning Models; Microseism; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Uncertainty Quantification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uncertainties exist in data measurements, source positioning, and subsurface geophysical properties. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a high-resolution depth migration approach useful for extracting information such as reservoir localization and boundaries. RTM, however, is time-consuming and data-intensive as it requires computing twice the wave equation to generate and store an imaging condition. RTM, when embedded in an uncertainty quantification algorithm (like the Monte Carlo method), shows a many-fold increase in its computational complexity due to the high input-output dimensionality. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder deep learning surrogate model for RTM under uncertainty. Inputs are an ensemble of velocity fields, expressing the uncertainty, and outputs the seismic images. We show by numerical experimentation that the surrogate model can reproduce the seismic images accurately, and, more importantly, the uncertainty propagation from the input velocity fields to the image ensemble.",2021-04-06,2024-09-03 21:52:11,2024-09-03 21:52:11,,1229-1250,,3,25.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media,,,,Autoencoder; Geophysical imaging; Inverse Problems; Propagation of uncertainty; Reservoir Simulation; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic migration; Seismic Waveform Inversion; Surrogate model; Synthetic data; Uncertainty quantification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, numerical solutions are susceptible to dispersion artifacts, and they often require considerable computational resources. Moreover, their accuracy is dependent on the size of discretization, which is a function of the operating frequency. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated the potential to tackle long-standing challenges in seismic modeling and inversion, addressing the associated computational bottleneck and numerical dispersion artifacts. Despite progress, PINNs exhibit spectral bias, resulting in a stronger capability to learn low-frequency features over high-frequency ones. This paper proposes the use of a simple fully-connected PINN model, and evaluates its potential to interpolate and extrapolate scattered wavefields that correspond to the acoustic VTI wave equation across multiple frequencies. The issue of spectral bias is tackled by incorporating the Kronecker neural network architecture with composite activation function formed using the inverse tangent (atan), exponential linear unit (elu), locally adaptive sine (l-sin), and locally adaptive cosine (l-cos) activation functions. This allows the construction of an effectively wider neural network with a minimal increase in the number of trainable parameters. The proposed scheme keeps the network size fixed for multiple frequencies and does not require repeated training at each frequency. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in fast and accurate, anisotropic multi-frequency wavefield modeling.",2023-08-08,2024-09-03 21:52:11,2024-09-03 21:52:11,,,,,11.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Frontiers Media,,,,Acoustic wave equation; Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Frequency-Dependent Anisotropy; Seismic Data Processing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newtonian coupling of ground vibrations to the core optics of the detectors may limit the sensitivity of Einstein Telescope at frequencies below about 10 Hz. The contribution of Newtonian noise is site specific and depends on the ambient seismic field which in turn depends on the site’s geology and the distribution of surface and underground seismic-noise sources. We have investigated the application of machine learning in combination with the deployment of seismic sensor networks to predict seismic displacement noise at specific locations on the surface and underground. Moreover we have modeled a deep neural network (DNN) that allows to subtract Newtonian noise from the strain data measured by Einstein Telescope. The seismic-field model is based on a complete solution of the elastodynamic wave equations for a horizontally-layered soil structure. The geology features soft-soil layers on hard-rock and was shown to be effective in attenuating Newtonian noise from surface waves below the required sensitivity. In addition our model includes a random background of body waves with all possible angles of incidence. We show that a DNN is effective in predicting Newtonian noise. Application of our DNN allows Newtonian noise subtraction by a factor up to 4.7 at 1 Hz and 2.5 at 5 Hz.",2023-09-18,2024-09-03 21:52:11,2024-09-03 21:52:11,,205008-205008,,20,40.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: IOP Publishing,,,,Earthquake Detection; Einstein Telescope; Seismic Noise; Seismic Phase Picking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Training data for deep neural networks is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on data generated by the FGA, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method. Further, results with a high accuracy are shown for more complicated geometries including a three-layered model, a sine interface, and a 2D-pocket model where the neural networks are trained by both clean and noisy data.",2020-05-01,2024-09-03 21:52:11,2024-09-03 21:52:11,,109313-109313,,,409.0,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,Publisher: Elsevier BV,,,,Distributed Acoustic Sensing; Earthquake Detection; Real-Time Seismology; Seismic Data Processing; Seismic Phase Picking; Substructure; Synthetic data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we utilize a recently introduced machine-learning based framework called physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the frequency-domain wave equation, which is also referred to as the Helmholtz equation, for isotropic and anisotropic media. Like functions, PINNs are formed by using a fully connected neural network (NN) to provide the wavefield solution at spatial points in the domain of interest, in which the coordinates of the point form the input to the network. We train such a network by backpropagating the misfit in the wave equation for the output wavefield values and their derivatives for many points in the model space. Generally, a hyperbolic tangent activation is used with PINNs, however, we use an adaptive sinusoidal activation function to optimize the training process. Numerical results show that PINNs with adaptive sinusoidal activation functions are able to generate frequency-domain wavefield solutions that satisfy wave equations. We also show the flexibility and versatility of the proposed method for various media, including anisotropy, and for models with strong irregular topography.",2022-03-01,2024-02-26 22:05:58,2024-09-02 14:58:45,2024-02-26 15:21:04,1750-1762,,3.0,228,,Geophysical Journal International,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,12 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\X99D5U55\Song et al. - 2022 - A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equat.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\XN57MPKA\6409132.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3RRBAM3N\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\JXISYF5P\Song et al. - 2022 - A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equat.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VEEKTIRQ\Song et al. - 2022 - A versatile framework to solve the Helmholtz equat.pdf,,Wave propagation; Neural networks; Numerical modelling; Seismic anisotropy; fuzzy logic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a notable challenge arises when modeling seismic wave propagation in large domains (i.e., a half-space), PINNs may encounter the issue of ""soft constraint failure"". To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called physics-constrained neural networks (PCNNs) specifically designed for modeling seismic wave propagation in a half-space. The method of images is incorporated to effectively implement the free stress boundary conditions of the Earth's surface, leading to the successful propagation of plane waves and cylindrical waves in a half-space. We analyze the training dynamics of neural networks when solving two-dimensional (2D) wave equations from the neural tangent kernel (NTK) perspective. An adaptive training algorithm is introduced to mitigate the unbalanced gradient flow dynamics of the different components of the loss function of PINNs/PCNNs.

We have developed a small-data-driven time-domain method for fast seismic simulations in complex media based on the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (FNO). Unlike most DL-based modeling schemes that either solve wave equations by embedding the physical constraints into the cost function or conduct physics-informed learning by incorporating the wave functions into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the FNO uses a learning architecture similar to the structure of split-step Fourier wave propagators, which is composed of two CNNs formulated in the space and wavenumber domains, respectively. The space-domain CNN acts as a local trainable phase-screen compensation. The wavenumber-domain CNN represents a nonlocal spatial convolutional operator acting as a trainable wavenumber filter for the phase-shift process. The FNO method approximates the mathematical-physical behavior of wave equations through learning the mapping between seismic wavefields at different time/locations from training seismic data. That is, the learning process parameterizes the integral kernel directly in the Fourier space, so that we can establish an expressive and efficient architecture for a better balance between accuracy and performance than the traditional spatial CNNs. Applications to gradient, layered, and Marmousi velocity models demonstrate its performance in accuracy and efficiency. The FNO seismic simulation is a data-driven method that needs a small amount of training data, especially when using blended source training data. It is a discretization-independent method that is not subject to the limitation of spatial sampling and time steps imposed on traditional numerical solvers, implying that the training data can be discretized arbitrarily. It also is a model-independent method that can include absorption attenuation into seismic modeling without the need of viscoelastic wave equations.",2022,2024-07-24 21:50:24,2024-09-02 15:17:21,,,,6.0,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,23 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\B9KQGJJB\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These synthetic case studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point sources. PINNs' meshless formalism allows for a flexible implementation of the wave equation and different types of boundary conditions. For instance, our models demonstrate that PINN automatically satisfies absorbing boundary conditions, a serious computational challenge for common wave propagation solvers. Furthermore, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure can be seamlessly encoded in PINNs' formulation. We find that the current state-of-the-art PINNs provide good results for the forward model, even though spectral element or finite difference methods are more efficient and accurate. More importantly, our results demonstrate that PINNs yield excellent results for inversions on all cases considered and with limited computational complexity. We discuss the current limitations of the method with complex velocity models as well as strategies to overcome these challenges.

However, obtaining such solutions in media characterized by strong parameter contrasts and anisotropy poses significant practical challenges to existing numerical solvers, especially for 3D scenarios. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) provide a computationally efficient alternative approach for AWE solutions. However, PINNs solve only a single instance of AWE and need to be re-trained for each different subsurface models and frequencies. Fourier neural operators, on the other hand, can solve AWE for a wide range of models and frequencies with a single set of network configuration and parameters. This method, though, requires a tremendous amount of data, which can be difficult and expensive to obtain. Here, we propose a methodology that combines PINNs with Fourier neural operators to learn AWE solution operators that are valid for a wide range of frequencies without requiring any training data.

Traditional neural networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), are restricted to the prediction of solutions in a predefined configuration. With neural operators, one can learn the general solution of Partial Differential Equations, such as the elastic wave equation, with varying parameters. There have been very few applications of neural operators in seismology. All of them were limited to two-dimensional settings, although the importance of three-dimensional (3D) effects is well known. In this work, we apply the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict ground motion time series from a 3D geological description. We used a high-fidelity simulation code, SEM3D, to build an extensive database of ground motions generated by 30,000 different geologies. With this database, we show that the FNO can produce accurate ground motion even when the underlying geology exhibits large heterogeneities. Intensity measures at moderate and large periods are especially well reproduced. We present the first seismological application of Fourier Neural Operators in 3D. Thanks to the generalizability of our database, we believe that our model can be used to assess the influence of geological features such as sedimentary basins on ground motion, which is paramount to evaluating site effects. © 2023 UNCECOMP Proceedings.

However, the conventional inversion strategy strongly depends on the initial model. In this work, we employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) to estimate the velocity and density fields based on acoustic wave equations. In contrast to the traditional purely data-driven machine learning approaches, PINNs leverage both available data and the physical laws that govern the observed data during the training stage. In this work, the first-order acoustic wave equations are embedded in the loss function as a regularization term for training the neural networks. In addition to the limited amount of measurements about the state variables available at the surface being used as the observational data, the well logging data is also used as the direct observational data about the model parameters. The numerical results from several benchmark problems demonstrate that given noise-free or noisy data, the proposed inversion strategy is not only capable of predicting the seismograms, but also estimating the velocity and density fields accurately.

In seismic imaging high-frequency data is advantageous since it can provide high resolution of substructures. However, generation of sufficient synthetic high-frequency data sets for training neural networks is computationally challenging. This bottleneck is overcome by a highly scalable computational platform built upon the FGA, which comes from the semiclassical theory and approximates the wavefields by a sum of fixed-width (frozen) Gaussian wave packets. Training data for deep neural networks is generated from a forward simulation of the elastic wave equation using the FGA. This data contains accurate traveltime information (from the ray path) but not exact amplitude information (with asymptotic errors not shrinking to zero even at extremely fine numerical resolution). Using this data we build convolutional neural network models using an open source API, GeoSeg, developed using Keras and Tensorflow. On a simple model, networks, despite only being trained on data generated by the FGA, can detect an interface with a high success rate from displacement data generated by the spectral element method. Benchmark tests are done for P-waves (acoustic) and P- and S-waves (elastic) generated using the FGA and a spectral element method.

The advancement of deep learning (DL) enables solving partial differential equations (PDEs), including wave equations, by applying neural networks to identify the mapping between the inputs and the solution. This approach can be faster than traditional numerical methods when numerous instances are to be solved. Previous works that concentrate on solving the wave equation by neural networks consider either a single velocity model or multiple simple velocity models, which is restricted in practice. Instead, inspired by the idea of operator learning, this work leverages the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to effectively learn the frequency domain seismic wavefields under the context of variable velocity models.

Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy of both FNO and PFNO with complicated velocity models in the OpenFWI datasets. Furthermore, the cross-dataset generalization test verifies that PFNO adapts to out-of-distribution velocity models.

We have developed a sequence of fast seismic acquisition for dispersion curve extraction and inversion for 3D seismic models, based on wavefield gradiometry, wave equation inversion, and machine-learning technology. The seismic array method that we use is Helmholtz wave equation inversion using measured wavefield gradients, and the dispersion curve inversions are based on a mixture of density neural networks (NNs). For our approach, we assume that a single surface wave mode dominates the data. We derive a nonlinear relationship among the unknown true seismic wave velocities, the measured seismic wave velocities, the interstation spacing, and the noise level in the signal. First with synthetic and then with the field data, we find that this relationship can be solved for unknown true seismic wave velocities using fixed point iterations. To estimate the noise level in the data, we need to assume that the effect of noise varies weakly with the frequency and we need to be able to calibrate the retrieved average dispersion curves with an alternate method (e.g., frequency wavenumber analysis). The method is otherwise self-contained and produces phase velocity estimates with tens of minutes of noise recordings. We use NNs, specifically a mixture density network, to approximate the nonlinear mapping between dispersion curves and their underlying 1D velocity profiles. The networks turn the retrieved dispersion model into a 3D seismic velocity model in a matter of seconds.

Its classic implementation involves forward modeling of seismic wavefield based on a certain type of wave equation, which reflects the physics nature of subsurface seismic wavefield propagation. However, obtaining a good inversion result using traditional seismic waveform inversion methods usually comes with a high computational cost. Recently, with the emerging popularity of deep learning techniques in various computer vision tasks, deep neural network (DNN) has demonstrated an impressive ability in dealing with complex nonlinear problems, including seismic velocity inversion. Now, extensive efforts have been made in developing a DNN architecture to tackle the problem of seismic velocity inversion, and promising results have been achieved. However, due to the dependence of a labeled dataset, i.e., the barely accessible true velocity model corresponding to real seismic data, the current supervised deep learning inversion framework may suffer from limitations on generalization. One possible solution to mitigate this issue is to impose the governing physics into this kind of purely data-driven method. Thus, following the procedures of traditional seismic full waveform inversion, we propose a seismic waveform inversion network, namely SWINet, based on wave-equation-based forward modeling network cells. By treating the single-shot observation data and its corresponding shot position as training data pairs, the inverted velocity model can be obtained as the trainable network parameters. Moreover, since the proposed seismic waveform inversion method is performed in a neural-network way, its implementation and inversion effect could benefit from some built-in tools in Pytorch, such as automatic differentiation, Adam optimizer and mini-batch strategy, etc. Numerical examples indicate that the SWINet method may possess great potential in resulting a good velocity inversion effect with relatively fast convergence and lower computation cost. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,2024-08-24 15:57:16,2024-08-26 04:12:29,,112266-112277,,,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,24 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\KEK5JVDB\Ren et al. - 2020 - A Physics-Based Neural-Network Way to Perform Seis.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\AHE5YR5I\display.html,,,Acoustic wavefield modeling; deep learning inversion; seismic waveform inversion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the advancement of machine learning technologies has infused new vitality into the research of seismic velocity inversion and yielded a wealth of research outcomes. Typically, seismic velocity inversion based on machine learning lacks control over physical processes and interpretability. Starting from wave theory and the physical processes of seismic data acquisition, this paper proposes a method for seismic velocity model inversion based on Physical Embedding Recurrent Neural Networks. Firstly, the wave equation is a mathematical representation of the physical process of acoustic waves propagating through a medium, and the finite difference method is an effective approach to solving the wave equation. With this in mind, we introduce the architecture of recurrent neural networks to describe the finite difference solution of the wave equation, realizing the embedding of physical processes into machine learning. Secondly, in seismic data acquisition, the propagation of acoustic waves from multiple sources through the medium represents a high-dimensional causal time series (wavefield snapshots), where the influential variable is the velocity model, and the received signals are the observations of the wavefield. This forms a forward modeling process as the forward simulation of the wavefield equation, and the use of error back-propagation between observations and calculations as the velocity inversion process. Through time-lapse inversion and by incorporating the causal information of wavefield propagation, the non-uniqueness issue in velocity inversion is mitigated. Through mathematical derivations and theoretical model analyses, the effectiveness and rationality of the method are demonstrated. In conjunction with simulation results for complex models, the method proposed in this paper can achieve velocity inversion in complex geological structures. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2024-08-24 16:01:33,2024-08-26 04:45:07,,,,24.0,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,29 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NU93K4BT\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\42JME73W\Lu y Zhang - 2023 - Seismic Velocity Inversion via Physical Embedding .pdf,,,seismic waveform inversion; causal sequence; physical information neural network; velocity modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional model-driven full-waveform inversion (FWI) methods, which rely on an initial velocity, suffer from low computational efficiency. Conversely, data-driven deep-learning (DL) approaches heavily rely on extensive training data and lack interpretability due to overreliance on training data for generalization. To address these challenges, we present a seismic velocity inversion network model that incorporates prior knowledge and constraints based on physical laws. The proposed approach involves constructing a data-driven inversion network with dual encoders and single decoder structure, enabling the learning of nonlinear mappings from seismic data to velocity models. By incorporating prior well-logging data and attention mechanisms, the inversion process is improved. In addition, a seismic forward modeling network based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is developed to solve the acoustic wave equation. Leveraging the advantages of parallel computing, the forward modeling process achieves fast calculations. The automatic differentiation algorithm in DL facilitates gradient calculations, specifically back propagation of the residuals to incorporate the physical constraints.

However, numerical solutions are susceptible to dispersion artifacts, and they often require considerable computational resources. Moreover, their accuracy is dependent on the size of discretization, which is a function of the operating frequency. Physics informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated the potential to tackle long-standing challenges in seismic modeling and inversion, addressing the associated computational bottleneck and numerical dispersion artifacts. Despite progress, PINNs exhibit spectral bias, resulting in a stronger capability to learn low-frequency features over high-frequency ones. This paper proposes the use of a simple fully-connected PINN model, and evaluates its potential to interpolate and extrapolate scattered wavefields that correspond to the acoustic VTI wave equation across multiple frequencies. The issue of spectral bias is tackled by incorporating the Kronecker neural network architecture with composite activation function formed using the inverse tangent (atan), exponential linear unit (elu), locally adaptive sine (l-sin), and locally adaptive cosine (l-cos) activation functions. This allows the construction of an effectively wider neural network with a minimal increase in the number of trainable parameters. The proposed scheme keeps the network size fixed for multiple frequencies and does not require repeated training at each frequency.

The skeletonized representation of the seismic traces consists of the low-rank latent-space variables predicted by a well-trained autoencoder neural network. The input to the autoencoder consists of seismic traces, and the implicit function theorem is used to determine the Fréchet derivative, i.e., the perturbation of the skeletonized data with respect to the velocity perturbation. The gradient is computed by migrating the shifted observed traces weighted by the skeletonized data residual, and the final velocity model is the one that best predicts the observed latent-space parameters. We denote this as inversion by Newtonian machine learning (NML) because it inverts for the model parameters by combining the forward and backward modeling of Newtonian wave propagation with the dimensional reduction capability of machine learning. Empirical results suggest that inversion by NML can sometimes mitigate the cycle-skipping problem of conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI). Numerical tests with synthetic and field data demonstrate the success of NML inversion in recovering a low-wavenumber approximation to the subsurface velocity model. The advantage of this method over other skeletonized data methods is that no manual picking of important features is required because the skeletal data are automatically selected by the autoencoder. The disadvantage is that the inverted velocity model has less resolution compared with the FWI result, but it can serve as a good initial model for FWI. Our most significant contribution is that we provide a general framework for using wave-equation inversion to invert skeletal data generated by any type of neural network.

Therefore, the seismic inversion problem based on partial differential wave equations can be addressed using automatic differentiation in the state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks, eliminating the need for explicit backpropagating the residual wavefield. However, one challenge that arises in the context of automatic differentiation is the significant memory usage due to the necessity of storing the hidden states of the RNN (i.e., wavefields in seismic modeling) during forward computation for constructing the computational graph and computing the derivatives during backpropagation. This memory overhead can become a bottleneck, particularly when dealing with large-scale inversion problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose an effective boundary-saving strategy that allows for the reconstruction of the computational graph during the backpropagation process. Instead of storing all the intermediate wavefields at each time step, we selectively save the necessary information at the boundaries, thereby significantly reducing the memory footprint. This approach enables us to maintain the convenience and efficiency of automatic differentiation computations while minimizing the memory requirements. Both 2-D and 3-D numerical experiments validate the accurate reconstruction of wavefields with minimal loss in precision, while the computational graph is simultaneously reconstructed. Consequently, the gradients can also be calculated correctly by automatic differentiation with minimal CPU/graphics processing unit (GPU) memory occupation. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",2023,2024-08-24 16:15:49,2024-08-26 05:57:04,,,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,39 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\I8TEJAKQ\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\G3TJ8JSJ\Wang et al. - 2023 - Memory Optimization in RNN-Based Full Waveform Inv.pdf,,,full waveform inversion; Automatic differentiation; boundary saving,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By taking advantage of the different kinematic properties of reflected and diffracted waves, we separate the two types of signals by migrating the seismic amplitudes to dip angle gathers using prestack depth imaging in the local angle domain.

The recently proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep-learning method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients are nonsmooth and describe structurally complex media. Thus, we solve the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field (Lippmann-Schwinger) wave equation in the frequency domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove the source singularity. We first illustrate that nonsmooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function to better couple the real and imaginary parts of the wavefield. Moreover, we design new neurons by replacing the classical affine function with a quadratic function in the argument of the activation function to better capture the nonsmooth features of the wavefields. We find that the PML condition and the quadratic functions improve the results including handling attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We also illustrate that a network trained to predict a wavefield for a specific medium can be used as an initial model of the neural network for predicting other wavefields corresponding to PDE-coefficient alterations and improving the convergence speed accordingly. This pretraining strategy should find applications in iterative full-waveform inversion and time-lag target-oriented imaging when the model perturbation between two consecutive iterations or two consecutive experiments is small. © 2023 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

This phenomenon is partially because of two reasons: 1) the variable dominant frequency (DF) distribution of random noise in different areas and 2) the different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the seismic data acquired from different areas. We have developed a deep-learning denoising method to suppress the random noise in different areas based on convolutional neural network (CNN). For a certain area, we leverage the wave equation and power spectrum analysis to construct a noise set whose DF distribution is close to that of the real random noise in this area, and then a CNN denoising model for this area can be obtained via the training of this noise set. In addition, an energy ratio factor is used to adjust the energy ratio of effective signal patch and noise patch in the training process, so as to improve the generalization ability of CNN denoising model to different SNRs.

It is of great significance to analyze the noise properties and establish accurate noise models. Since the complex changes of the actual medium seriously affect propagation characteristics, it is necessary to establish a noise model in a more realistic medium. In this letter, we suppose a weakly heterogeneous medium whose properties vary with the position. And the link between the Lam constants of the medium and noise properties is established. Therefore, a wave equation is deduced in that medium to describe the propagation law of desert seismic exploration random noise. Based on the Greens function, the random noise field is obtained by superimposing all wave fields excited by each pointlike source. Afterward, quantitative comparisons between the actual random noise and the proposed random noise model are given. The results manifest that there are significant similarities in mathematical characteristics between them. Moreover, compared with the noise model in the homogeneous medium, the proposed noise model is more reliable. In order to prove the application value of the random noise model, it is first applied to construct a complete training set for denoising convolutional neural networks, which is valuable for attenuating the desert seismic exploration random noise. This is an effective way to extend noise data.

Employing the acoustic or elastic wave equation, inversion starts with approximate estimates of subsurface parameters, which are typically updated in iterative fashion. We propose a two-stage unsupervised machine-learning (ML) methodology for efficient and accurate seismic impedance inversion. The first stage utilizes the generalization capability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to produce realistic estimates of the acoustic impedance (AI), whereas the second stage incorporates physics information to generate synthetic data from the subsurface AI distribution. We also add Bayesian layers to the first stage of the network to evaluate the model errors. The proposed probabilistic approach to deep learning allows one to estimate the uncertainty of the obtained parameters, which enhances the interpretability of the model. We apply the algorithm to a poststack data set generated using the CGG Hampson-Russell software. After conducting network training using a small number of data points, the network is applied to the rest of the data to calculate the model parameters.

The drill-string dynamics are represented by a distributed dynamical model (wave equations) coupled with an ordinary differential equation at the downhole boundary (bit-rock interaction). The interaction between the drill-bit and rock can introduce severe vibrations in the drill-string and result in safety and performance issues. Consequently, the performance of drilling is interwoven with our knowledge of the subsurface. To address these problems, we propose a sensing and computational framework for estimating the drill-string dynamics and the specific intrinsic energy of the rocks while drilling. By exploiting the derived models’ particular structure, we combine the drill-string dynamics modeling with top-drive hook-load (force) and hook-speed (velocity) measurements to estimate the force-on-bit without requiring the knowledge of the sub-surface. Then, we record and model the seismic radiation patterns of drill-bit rock interactions near the surface (i.e., seismic while drilling). Such an idea allows deriving an appropriate estimation of the rocks’ intrinsic energy while drilling. We introduce two alternative rock property estimation algorithms based on direct parameter estimation and machine learning concepts to complete the analysis. The different approaches are tested and validated in simulations. We discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks.

However, Monte Carlo techniques are computationally expensive since they require repeated solution of the wave equation for each proposed velocity model. One approach to reduce the computational expense is two-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), wherein a computationally inexpensive filter is used to quickly reject unacceptable models. This filter reduces the number of models that must be tested using the full fine-grid forward solver. Often, coarse-grid formulations of the forward problems are used in the filter stage. We instead use a neural network to replace the expensive computation of the residual directly. In addition, we train the neural network as part of the MCMC process, bypassing the need to generate separate training data outside of the MCMC process. We find that the neural network two-stage MCMC (NNMCMC) substantially reduces the time-per-trial and time-per-rejection by 65% and 84%, respectively, when compared with the one-stage MCMC.

However, it is time consuming if many frequencies are involved for solving the linear wave equations, particularly, for large 3D velocity models. We propose accelerating the modeling by applying deep learning. Because similarity appears among the wavefields in near frequencies, we can extract similar features and reconstruct the unknown wavefields by deep learning. We compute fewer frequency-domain wavefields with a large frequency interval by conventional modeling methods, such as finite-difference methods, and then interpolate more frequency-domain wavefields with a small frequency interval by applying deep learning. Numerical examples demonstrate that the U-Net, which is trained by the data on 10 2D simple-layered models, can be used to interpolate the data on SEG Advanced Modeling models and also can be used to interpolate the data on the 3D layered model and 3D overthrust model. A series of tests on perturbation models prove that the U-Net performance is still good when the root-mean-square value of the velocity model perturbation relative to the initial model is up to 15%. Compared with traditional modeling methods, the computational time of interpolating by applying deep learning is negligible, especially for 3D models. After the network is trained, the acceleration strategy helps to reduce the runtime by approximately 50% for a modeling problem because the U-Net can be used to interpolate 50% of the data that would otherwise need to be modeled. Although training the model will take some time, good generalization of the U-Net, especially for 3D problems, enhances its benefits on the application for frequency-domain forward modeling. © 2022 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",2022,2024-08-24 16:41:36,2024-09-02 15:37:12,,T315-T328,,4.0,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,59 - Yes - Forward,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\RIH8GKFV\Cao et al. - 2022 - Accelerating 2D and 3D frequency-domain seismic wa.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\VUF6CY2V\display.html,,,machine learning; modeling; frequency domain; finite difference; interpolation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Newtonian coupling of ground vibrations to the core optics of the detectors may limit the sensitivity of Einstein Telescope at frequencies below about 10 Hz. The contribution of Newtonian noise is site specific and depends on the ambient seismic field which in turn depends on the site’s geology and the distribution of surface and underground seismic-noise sources. We have investigated the application of machine learning in combination with the deployment of seismic sensor networks to predict seismic displacement noise at specific locations on the surface and underground. Moreover we have modeled a deep neural network (DNN) that allows to subtract Newtonian noise from the strain data measured by Einstein Telescope. The seismic-field model is based on a complete solution of the elastodynamic wave equations for a horizontally-layered soil structure. The geology features soft-soil layers on hard-rock and was shown to be effective in attenuating Newtonian noise from surface waves below the required sensitivity.

The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion. However, our ability to attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural network (NN) parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the NN with a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source at the surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach. © 2021 The Authors",2021,2024-08-24 17:22:32,2024-08-26 16:43:49,,11-19,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,72 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\Q6LF4KDN\Alkhalifah et al. - 2021 - Wavefield solutions from machine learned functions.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\NTJCFYEJ\display.html,,,Helmholtz equation; Deep learning; Modeling; Neural networks; Wavefields,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use a U-shaped neural operator to learn a general solution operator to the 2-D elastic wave equation from an ensemble of numerical simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations.

Thousands of such forward simulations are often a routine requirement for parameter estimation of microseimsic events via a suitable source inversion process. Parameter estimation based on forward modelling is often advantageous over a direct regression-based inversion approach when there are unknown number of parameters to be estimated and the seismic data have complicated noise characteristics which may not always allow a stable and unique solution in a direct inversion process. In this paper, starting from Graphics Processing Unit based synthetic simulations of a few thousand forward seismic shots due to microseismic events via pseudo-spectral solution of elastic wave equation, we develop a step-by-step process to generate a surrogate regression modelling framework, using machine learning techniques that can produce accurate seismograms at specified receiver locations. The trained surrogate models can then be used as a high-speed meta-model/emulator or proxy for the original full elastic wave propagator to generate seismic responses for other microseismic event locations also. The accuracies of the surrogate models have been evaluated using two independent sets of training and testing Latin hypercube quasi-random samples, drawn from a heterogeneous marine velocity model. The predicted seismograms have been used thereafter to calculate batch likelihood functions, with specified noise characteristics. Finally, the trained models on 23 receivers placed at the sea-bed in a marine velocity model are used to determine the maximum likelihood estimate of the event locations which can in future be used in a Bayesian analysis for microseismic event detection. © The Author(s) 2018.",2018,2024-08-24 17:27:17,2024-08-28 00:11:54,,1257-1290,,2.0,215,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,76 - Yes - Forward,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\2H72UXL7\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\W7ZK9TN4\Das et al. - 2018 - Surrogate regression modelling for fast seismogram.pdf,,,Computational seismology; Joint inversion; Seismic noise; Statistical methods; Statistical seismology; Time-series analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uncertainties exist in data measurements, source positioning, and subsurface geophysical properties. Reverse time migration (RTM) is a high-resolution depth migration approach useful for extracting information such as reservoir localization and boundaries. RTM, however, is time-consuming and data-intensive as it requires computing twice the wave equation to generate and store an imaging condition. RTM, when embedded in an uncertainty quantification algorithm (like the Monte Carlo method), shows a many-fold increase in its computational complexity due to the high input-output dimensionality. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder deep learning surrogate model for RTM under uncertainty. Inputs are an ensemble of velocity fields, expressing the uncertainty, and outputs the seismic images. We show by numerical experimentation that the surrogate model can reproduce the seismic images accurately, and, more importantly, the uncertainty propagation from the input velocity fields to the image ensemble. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2024-08-24 17:39:18,2024-09-02 16:26:00,,1229-1250,,3.0,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,86 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BZ28ARM5\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\3LPP73LC\Freitas et al. - 2021 - An encoder-decoder deep surrogate for reverse time.pdf,,,Deep learning; Uncertainty quantification; Reverse time migration; Surrogate modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inferring the joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and source location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the inference process requires forward modelling of microseismic traces for each set of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference very computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this process by training deep-learning models to learn the mapping between source location and seismic traces for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model and a fixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace the expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process. We compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on Gaussian processes to invert microseismic events. For fairness of comparison, we train our emulators on the same microseismic traces and using the same geophysical setting. We show that all of our models provide more accurate predictions, g1/4g€¯100 times faster predictions than the method based on Gaussian processes, and a O(105) speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform generation. For example, a 2g€¯s long synthetic trace can be generated in g1/4g€¯10 ms on a common laptop processor, instead of g1/4g€¯1g€¯h using a pseudo-spectral method on a high-profile graphics processing unit card. We also show that our inference results are in excellent agreement with those obtained from traditional location methods based on travel time estimates. The speed, accuracy, and scalability of our open-source deep-learning models pave the way for extensions of these emulators to generic source mechanisms and application to joint Bayesian inversion of moment tensor components and source location using full waveforms. © Copyright:",2021,2024-08-24 17:40:07,2024-08-26 17:26:33,,1683-1705,,7.0,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,87 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BVHFBUX5\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\DXANI2WI\Spurio Mancini et al. - 2021 - Accelerating Bayesian microseismic event location .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full waveform inversion seeks to match observed seismic data with synthesized seismograms by iteratively updating subsurface model parameters. Synthetic data are generated by solving the seismic wave equation using an effective and efficient numerical algorithm. In order to ensure inversion accuracy and stability, both synthesized and observed seismograms must be carefully pre-processed. More specifically, when synthetic and observed data have a large waveform mismatch during the initial iterations, waveforms should be carefully selected for calculating the misfit gradient in order to avoid instability. We introduce a fully automated algorithm based on machine learning (ML) to intelligently select time windows for calculating the misfit between observed and synthetic seismograms. The training dataset can be prepared using time windows obtained based on the FLEXWIN method, in which selection parameters are finely tuned. Results show that automatically selected time windows are of sufficiently high quality compared with the benchmark FLEXWIN method. © 2017 SEG.",2017,2024-08-24 17:41:02,2024-09-02 16:32:02,,1604-1609,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,89 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\4QXD5AUV\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied an automatic workflow to continuous data from 43 seismic stations in Puerto Rico to build an enhanced earthquake catalog with ∼180,000 events for the 3+ yr sequence from 28 December 2019 to 1 January 2023. This workflow contained the EQTransformer (EQT) deep learning model for event detection and phase picking, the EikoNet-Hypocenter Inversion with Stein Variational Inference probabilistic earthquake location approach with a neural network trained to solve the eikonal wave equation, and relocation with event-pair waveform cross correlation. EQT increased the number of catalog events in the sequence by about seven times, though its performance was not quite as good as thorough analyst review. The enhanced catalog revealed new structural details of the sequence space–time evolution, including sudden changes in activity, on a complex system of many small normal and strike-slip faults. This sequence started on 28 December 2019 with an M 4.7 strike-slip earthquake followed by 10 days of shallow strike-slip foreshocks, including several M 5+ earthquakes, in a compact region. The oblique normal fault Mw 6.4 mainshock then hap-pened on 7 January 2020. Early aftershocks in January 2020, with several M 5+ earthquakes, quickly expanded into two intersecting fault zones with diffuse seismicity: one extending ∼ 35 km on a northward-dipping normal fault and the other ∼60-km-long and oriented west-northwest–east-southeast on strike-slip faults. Months to years later, aftershocks moved westward, deeper, and to outer reaches of the active fault zones, with abrupt rapid seismicity migration following larger M 4.7+ aftershocks in May, July, and December 2020. The observed seismicity evolution indicates cascading failure from stress transfer on multiple critically stressed faults. High aftershock productivity results from the complex multiple-fault network hosting the sequence, which is characteristic of an immature fault system in the diffuse deformation zone around Puerto Rico, at the complicated North American– Caribbean plate boundary region. © Seismological Society of America.",2023,2024-08-24 17:41:29,2024-08-28 23:30:57,,2377-2415,,6.0,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,90 - Yes - Inverse,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\HA9EUC24\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\DMKY9W86\Yoon et al. - 2023 - A Detailed View of the 2020–2023 Southwestern Puer.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, Monte Carlo techniques are computationally expensive since they require repeated solution of the wave equation for each proposed velocity model. One approach to reduce the computational expense is two-stage Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), wherein a computationally inexpensive filter is used to quickly reject unacceptable models. This filter reduces the number of models that must be tested using the full fine-grid forward solver. Often, coarse-grid formulations of the forward problems are used in the filter stage. We instead use a neural network to replace the expensive computation of the residual directly. In addition, we train the neural network as part of the MCMC process, bypassing the need to generate separate training data outside of the MCMC process. We find that the neural network two-stage MCMC (NNMCMC) substantially reduces the time-per-trial and time-per-rejection by 65% and 84%, respectively, when compared with the one-stage MCMC. Furthermore, NNMCMC increases the acceptance rate to 86% from 29% over the one-stage MCMC. © 2019 SEG",2019,2024-08-27 23:32:35,2024-08-28 23:46:01,,1665-1669,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,52 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\CAAJCCN5\Stuart et al. - 2019 - Enhanced neural network sampling for two-stage Mar.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, deep learning (DL), as a data-driven approach, has been attracting increasing interest in seismic inversion. DL is proven to have the potential to learn complex systems and solve inverse problems efficiently. One of the most key components of DL is the training dataset, and an effective training dataset is a prerequisite for the success of DL-based methods. In seismic inversion, the training dataset needs to be artificially expanded due to the limited number of actual training data pairs. Traditional approaches of using the exact Zoeppritz equation (EZE) or its approximations for training dataset construction have limitations, principally, the single interface assumption and the neglect of wave propagation effects. Alternatively, the analytical solution of the 1-D wave equation (i.e., reflectivity method [RM]) can simulate the full wave, including transmission losses and internal multiples, and can be executed in a target-oriented manner. Inspired by this, we develop a data-driven elastic parameter prediction method based on waveform formulation. The method uses RM to construct training dataset, which both compensates for the inadequate training dataset in data-driven seismic inversion and improves the accuracy of the inversion results. We implement the method in a synthetic model as well as field data. The results are compared with model-driven methods (EZE and RM) and data-driven method based on EZE, and it is shown that the proposed method outperforms these three methods. © 1980-2012 IEEE.",2022,2024-08-28 15:37:14,2024-09-02 16:43:52,,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,96 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\KYTK3PA8\display.html; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\QBI6WZH6\Zhang et al. - 2022 - Deep Learning Seismic Inversion Based on Prestack .pdf,,,waveform inversion; Deep learning (DL); reflectivity method (RM); reservoir characterization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total cost strictly depends on the number of frequency components that are considered, if using a finite-difference method.

A trained neural operator can compute a solution in negligible time for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As neural operators are grid free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency.

The LS features are the effective low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional seismic data. However, no equations exist to describe the relationship between the perturbation of an LS feature and the velocity perturbation. To address this problem, we use automatic differentiation (AD) to connect the two terms. Following this step, we use the wave-equation inversion to invert the LS features for the subsurface velocity model. The HML misfit function measures the LS feature differences between the observed and predicted seismic data in a low-dimensional space, which is less affected by the cycle-skipping problem compared to the waveform mismatch in a high-dimensional space. A low dimensional LS feature mainly contains the kinematic information of seismic data, while a large dimensional LS feature can also preserve the dynamic information of seismic data. Therefore, the HML inversion can recover the subsurface velocity model in a multiscale approach by inverting the LS features with different dimensions. Based on the different ways of utilizing AD to compute the velocity gradient, we propose full- and semi-automatic approaches to solve this problem. These two approaches are mathematically equivalent; the former is easier to implement, while the latter is computationally more efficient. Numerical tests show that the HML inversion method can effectively recover both the low- and high-wavenumber velocity information by inverting the LS features with different dimensions. © 2021 American Geophysical Union.

However, differences between simulated data and field data in terms of signal regulations and noise distributions often lead to poor results. An alternative approach is self-supervised learning, such as the representative framework, blind spot network (BSN), but unfortunately, the effective information in blind spots cannot be fully utilized. To solve this problem, this letter considers BSN as a basis and establishes a novel self-supervised network-blind spot visualization (BSV) to suppress random noise and improve the quality of DAS VSP data. In BSV, one branch is dedicated to first produce more denoised data with blind spots and then recover the valid information covered by the blind spots, assuming that the signal is partially data-dependent and the DAS noise is conditionally data-independent. The other branch is designed to generate a target for training without blind spots so that the dual-branch network can accomplish a self-supervised task in the way of supervised learning. More than that, unlike BSN, we utilize a tailor-made blind spot mapper (BSM) to recover effective information in the blind spots. Results of field data testing prove BSV's advantages in suppressing random noise and improving the quality of DAS VSP data, although test on synthetic data is nearly identical to supervised learning. © 2004-2012 IEEE.",2024,2024-08-28 15:44:05,2024-09-02 17:01:21,,1-5,,,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,102  - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\D3ZLS4U9\Ma et al. - 2024 - Improving Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Qualit.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\P7ZHUI9N\display.html,,,Blind spot network (BSN); blind spot visualization (BSV); distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) vertical seismic profile (VSP) data; seismic data denoising; self-supervised deep learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ICB7GFIR,journalArticle,2021,"Khasi, S.; Fayazi, A.; Kantzas, A.",Effects of Acoustic Stimulation on Fluid Flow in Porous Media,Energy and Fuels,,,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.1c02631,,"Acoustic waves are mechanical waves that can be generated via vibrations. The use of such waves for enhancing flow and transport in porous media has some advantages over traditional enhanced recovery methods including eliminating bypassing effects and environmental hazards. Many physical mechanisms have been identified to improve recovery by applying an acoustic wave. However, the relative contributions of different mechanisms to the stimulated flow and transport phenomena are not still well understood. There are also uncertainties regarding the effects of important controlling factors such as frequency or the efficiency of different source coupling methods. In this work, a multiphysics model is developed to address the latter issues and propose a criterion to distinguish different regimes of acoustically induced effects. Simulation results of this model are correlated to the recovery enhancements to provide the required applied stress or supplied energy that causes observable changes in fluid flow behavior under laboratory conditions. A loss number ofNlis proposed based on the dimensionless analysis of wave equation in fluids where the most energy dissipation occurs. The critical values ofNlare obtained by implementing a classifier machine learning algorithm on a data set from the literature. WhenNlis less than 2.1 × 10-7, the recovery enhancement is expected to be caused by mechanical effects, and therefore lower frequency (seismic) waves are favorable. At anNlgreater than 10-6, however, higher frequency (ultrasonic) waves are preferred since the changes in flow behavior are triggered by the adsorbed acoustic energy. In seismic excitations, coupling the source to the pore fluid gives the highest performance, while in ultrasonic treatments, the maximum viscosity reduction can be achieved when a transient frequency scenario is adopted. The results of this study give a better understanding of mechanisms behind the effect of acoustic wave application in porous media. © 2021 American Chemical Society",2021,2024-08-28 15:45:27,2024-09-02 17:06:09,,17580-17601,,21.0,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,103 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\ID4ZB7QN\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the improved spatial resolution and the ability to constrain multiple parameters simultaneously demand substantial computational resources for the recurring simulations of the wave equation. Hence, it is crucial to use fast and accurate methods for numerical wave propagation, on the one hand, and to keep the number of required simulations as small as possible, on the other hand. We present an efficient strategy for acoustic waveform inversion that combines (i) a spectral-element continuous Galerkin method for solving the wave equation, (ii) conforming hexahedral mesh generation to discretize the scanning device, (iii) a randomized descent method based on mini-batches to reduce the computational cost for misfit and gradient computations, and (iv) a trust-region method using a quasi-Newton approximation of the Hessian to iteratively solve the inverse problem. This approach combines ideas and state-of-the-art methods from global-scale seismology, large-scale nonlinear optimization, and machine learning. Numerical examples for a synthetic phantom demonstrate the efficiency of the discretization, the effectiveness of the mini-batch approximation and the robustness of the trust-region method to reconstruct the acoustic properties of breast tissue with partial information. © 2018 SPIE.",2018,2024-08-28 15:47:59,2024-09-02 17:07:27,,,,,10580,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,104 - No,,C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\F7UIK2UB\Boehm et al. - 2018 - Time-domain spectral-element ultrasound waveform t.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\5P9ADJK2\display.html,,,waveform inversion; spectral-element method; stochastic L-BFGS; ultrasound tomography,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging - Proceedings of SPIE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The network is tuned to map multi-shot seismic traces to velocity models. We train the network with pairs of synthetic velocity models and their corresponding multi-shot seismic traces which are simulated from the velocity models with acoustic wave equations. Multiple shots are used as channels in the network to increase data redundancy. The training process is expensive, but it only occurs once up front. The trained network is then used to predict velocity models from testing seismic traces, and it shows satisfactory prediction results. The cost for predicting velocity models is negligible once the training is complete. © 2018 SEG",2018,2024-09-02 14:21:07,2024-09-02 14:21:22,,2086-2090,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,88 - Duplicated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SEG Technical Program Expanded Abstracts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
