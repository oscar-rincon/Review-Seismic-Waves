"6LNHR8GS","book","2005","Tarantola, Albert","Inverse problem theory and methods for model parameter estimation","","0-89871-572-5","","","https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898717921","While the prediction of observations is a forward problem, the use of actual observations to infer the properties of a model is an inverse problem. Inverse problems are difficult because they may not have a unique solution. The description of uncertainties plays a central role in the theory, which is based on probability theory. This book proposes a general approach that is valid for linear as well as for nonlinear problems. The philosophy is essentially probabilistic and allows the reader to understand the basic difficulties appearing in the resolution of inverse problems. The book attempts to explain how a method of acquisition of information can be applied to actual real-world problems, and many of the arguments are heuristic. Prompted by recent developments in inverse theory, Inverse Problem Theory and Methods for Model Parameter Estimation is a completely rewritten version of a 1987 book by the same author. In this version there are lots of algorithmic details for Monte Carlo methods, least-squares discrete problems, and least-squares problems involving functions. In addition, some notions are clarified, the role of optimization techniques is underplayed, and Monte Carlo methods are taken much more seriously. The first part of the book deals exclusively with discrete inverse problems with a finite number of parameters while the second part of the book deals with general inverse problems.","2005","2023-09-22 13:57:47","2024-07-11 14:46:14","","","358","","","","","","","","","","SIAM","","en","","","","","","","Citation Key: tarantola2005inverse","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\U3GF83X7\Tarantola - 2005 - Inverse problem theory and methods for model param.pdf","","inverse methods; inverse problems; least-squares; uncertainties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach represents a streamlined method of processing the entire acoustic waveform instead of performing manual, and often arbitrary, waveform peak selection. For applications where computational economy is prioritised, simple metrics of statistical significance are used to formally identify the most informative waveform features. These alone can be exploited for SoC inference. It is further shown that signal portions representing both early and late interfacial reflections can correlate highly with the SoC and be of predictive value, challenging the more common peak selection methods which focus on the latter. Although later echoes represent greater through-thickness coverage, and are intuitively more information-rich, their presence is not guaranteed. Holistic waveform treatment offers a more robust approach to correlating acoustic signatures to electrochemical states. It is further demonstrated that transformation into the frequency domain can reduce the dimensionality of the problem significantly, while also improving the estimation accuracy. Most importantly, it is shown that acoustic signatures can be used as sole model inputs to produce highly accurate SoC estimates, without any complementary voltage information. This makes the method suitable for applications where redundancy and diversification of SoC estimation approaches is needed. Data is obtained experimentally from a 210 mAh LiCoO2/graphite pouch cell. Mean estimation errors as low as 0.75% are achieved on a SoC scale of 0–100%.","2022-11-01","2023-09-22 12:30:20","2023-09-22 12:30:37","2023-09-22 12:30:20","100188","","","10","","Energy and AI","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\K9ZYXBPW\Galiounas et al. - 2022 - Battery state-of-charge estimation using machine l.pdf; C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\YYQRHNIZ\S2666546822000374.html","","acoustic battery inspection; artificial neural networks; battery diagnostics; machine learning; mechanical-electrochemical correlation; ultrasonic battery monitoring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
