The generalized finite difference method (GFDM), which is based on the Taylor series expansion and weighted least square fitting, solves these problems. The partial derivative of the unknown parameters in the differential equation is represented by the linear combination of the function values of adjacent nodes. In this study, the Poisson disk node generation algorithm and the centroid Voronoi node adjustment algorithm were combined to obtain an even and random node distribution. The generated nodes fit the internal boundary more accurately for model discretization, without the presence of diffracted waves caused by the stepped grid. To avoid the instability caused by the introduction of boundary conditions, a Cerjan damping boundary condition was proposed for boundary reflection processing. The test results generated by the different models showed that the generalized finite difference method can effectively solve the problems related to inaccurate travel time of reflection waves and stepped grid diffraction.","2023-02","2024-01-28 01:49:36","2024-02-08 18:53:24","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\BCTSY2MD\Liu et al. - 2023 - Simulation of Elastic Wave Propagation Based on Me.pdf","","centroid Voronoi; Cerjan damping boundary condition; Elastic wave modeling; finite diference method; generalized finite difference method (GFDM)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book offers a comprehensive introduction to FD and its applications to earthquake motion. Using a systematic tutorial approach, the book requires only undergraduate degree-level mathematics and provides a user-friendly explanation of the relevant theory. It explains FD schemes for solving wave equations and elastodynamic equations of motion in heterogeneous media, and provides an introduction to the rheology of viscoelastic and elastoplastic media. It also presents an advanced FD time-domain method for efficient numerical simulations of earthquake ground motion in realistic complex models of local surface sedimentary structures. Accompanied by a suite of online resources to help put the theory into practice, this is a vital resource for professionals and academic researchers using numerical seismological techniques, and graduate students in earthquake seismology, computational and numerical modelling, and applied mathematics. A systematic tutorial introduction to the finite-difference (FD) numerical modelling technique for professionals, academic researchers, and graduate students in seismology.

It is found that a more complex algorithm does not only require longer time to implement, but also yields an erroneous reconstruction. The reconstruction suffers from contrast degradation, phase shifts, and attenuation of details relative to the true signal. These unwanted effects are caused by the existence of spurious frequencies in the computed spectrum due to rounding‐off errors. The amplitude distribution of the spurious frequencies across the spectral bandwidth strongly depends on the number of data points handled and on the complexity of the particular reconstruction algorithm employed. Since the floating point representation of numbers in a computer is always finite, an upper limit exists in the maximum number of additions or multiplications required to compute a quantity reliably without errors.","1993-11-01","2024-07-09 17:47:34","2024-07-09 17:47:34","2024-07-09 17:47:34","5314-5319","","9","74","","Journal of Applied Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\5SM3QLMS\Computational-complexity-and-the-observation-of.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model is dynamic since we specify the effective stress at the fault. In one model we assume that the fault appears instantaneously in the medium; in another, that the rupture nucleates at the center and that rupture proceeds at constant subsonic velocity until it suddenly stops. The total source slip is larger at the center and the rise time is also longer at the center of the fault. The dynamic slip overshoots the static slip by 15 to 35 per cent. As a consequence, the stress drop is larger than the effective stress and the apparent stress is less than one half the effective stress.The far-field radiation is discussed in detail. We distinguish three spectral regions. First, the usual constant low-frequency level. Second, an intermediate region controlled by the fault size and, finally, the high-frequency asymptote. The central region includes the corner frequency and is quite complicated. The corner frequency is shown to be inversely proportional to the width of the far-field displacement pulse which, in turn, is related to the time lag between the stopping phases. The average corner frequency of S waves v0s is related to the final source radius, a, by v0s = 0.21 β/α. The corner frequency of P waves is larger than v0s by an average factor of 1.5.","1976-06-01","2024-07-23 00:11:59","2024-07-23 00:11:59","2024-02-20 00:27:46","639-666","","3","66","","Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\orincon\Zotero\storage\JQBTZHXY\Dynamics-of-an-expanding-circular-fault.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, at grazing incidence the classical discrete PML method suffers from large spurious reflections that make it less efficient for instance in the case of very thin mesh slices, in the case of sources located close to the edge of the mesh, and/or in the case of receivers located at very large offset. We demonstrate how to improve the PML at grazing incidence for the differential seismic wave equation based on an unsplit convolution technique. The improved PML has a cost that is similar in terms of memory storage to that of the classical PML. We illustrate the efficiency of this improved convolutional PML based on numerical benchmarks using a finite-difference method on a thin mesh slice for an isotropic material and show that results are significantly improved compared with the classical PML technique. We also show that, as the classical PML, the convolutional technique is intrinsically unstable in the case of some anisotropic materials.","2007-09","2024-07-23 00:26:12","2024-07-23 00:26:12","2024-07-16 17:31:22","SM155-SM167","","5","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","library.seg.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Society of Exploration Geophysicists","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
