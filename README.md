# A Review of Recent Progress in Seismic Waves Propagation Modeling Using Machine Learning Based Methods

Numerical modeling has been crucial for addressing problems across various scientific and engineering 
disciplines involving partial differential equations. In particular, wave propagation modeling has seen
significant development in scientific computation. Standard numerical modeling methods have demonstrated 
notable accuracy; however, their computational cost can be substantial. Recently, alternative methods based 
on machine learning have emerged, offering a promising balance between computational cost and accuracy 
when applied to wave propagation problems. In this work, we present a review of methods developed and used 
to model wave propagation, with a special emphasis on computational seismology. We discuss the fundamentals 
of wave propagation modeling, standard numerical methods, and recent advances in solving differential 
equations through these approaches. We conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify 
applications where these methods, either standalone or in hybrid approaches with standard numerical methods, 
have demonstrated efficiency in terms of computational time. The results of this review provide insights 
into the potential of machine learning techniques for wave propagation modeling and their impact on 
computational seismology.
